These essentials are the backbone of building accurate, scalable ML systems. Let’s connect and exchange ideas on machine learning innovations!


As someone passionate about data science and innovation, I believe mastering these fundamentals is the first step toward building cutting-edge solutions. Whether it's

Part 1 :core concepts
Types of Learning
These are the main machine learning problems:
Classification: learn to put instances into pre-defined classes.
Association: learn relationships between attributes.
Numeric prediction: learn to predict a numeric quantity instead of a class.
Clustering: discover classes of instances that belong together.
Here is the exact text from the image:

Clustering vs. Classification
Classification: the task is to learn to assign instances to predefined classes.
Clustering: no predefined classification is required. The task is to learn a classification from the data.
Clustering algorithms divide a data set into natural groups (clusters). Instances in the same cluster are similar to each other, they share certain properties.
Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

Supervised learning: classification requires supervised learning, i.e., the training data has to specify what we are trying to learn (the classes).
Unsupervised learning: clustering is an unsupervised task, i.e., the training data doesn’t specify what we are trying to learn (the clusters).
Learning Bias
To generalize successfully, a machine learning system uses a learning bias to guide it through the space of possible concepts. Also called inductive bias (Mitchell 1997).
Language bias: the language in which the result is expressed determines which concepts can be learned.
Search bias: the way the space of possible concepts is searched determines the outcome of learning.
Overfitting-avoidance bias: avoid learning a concept that overfits, i.e., just enumerates the training data: this will give very bad results on test data, as it lacks the ability to generalize to unseen instances.
Part2:   EVALAUATION 
Training and Test Set
For classification problems, we measure the performance of a model in terms of its error rate: percentage of incorrectly classified instances in the data set.
We build a model because we want to use it to classify new data. Hence, we are chiefly interested in model performance on new (unseen) data.
The resubstitution error (error rate on the training set) is a bad predictor of performance on new data.
The model was built to account for the training data, so might overfit it, i.e., not generalize to unseen data.

Crossvalidation
Testing is done either on a hold-out part of the data or using k-fold crossvalidation:
Divide data randomly into k folds (subsets) of equal size.
Train the model on k − 1 folds, use one fold for testing.
Repeat this process k times so that all folds are used for testing.
Compute the average performance on the k test sets.
This effectively uses all the data for both training and testing. Typically k = 10 is used.

Comparing against a Baseline
An error rate in itself is not very meaningful. We have to take into account how hard the problem is.
This means comparing against a baseline model and showing that our model performs significantly better than the baseline.
The simplest model is the chance baseline, which assigns a classification randomly.
Problem: a chance baseline is not useful if the distribution of the data is skewed.
We need to compare against a frequency baseline instead. A frequency baseline always assigns the most frequent class.

Precision and Recall
Measures commonly used in information retrieval, based on true positives, false positives, and false negatives:
Precision: number of class members classified correctly over total number of instances classified as class members. Precision=TPTP+FP\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}Precision=TP+FPTP​
Recall: number of class members classified correctly over total number of class members. Recall=TPTP+FN\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}Recall=TP+FNTP​

Evaluating Clustering Models
Problem: How do we evaluate the performance on the test set? How do we know if the clusters are correct? Possible solutions:
Test the resulting clusters intuitively, i.e., inspect them and see if they make sense. Not advisable.
Have an expert generate clusters manually, and test the automatically generated ones against them.
Test the clusters against a predefined classification if there is one.
Perform task-based evaluation, i.e., test if the performance of some other algorithm can be improved by using the output of the clusterer.
Part 3:CORE ALGORITHM
ID3 Algorithm
Informal formulation of the ID3 algorithm for decision tree induction:
Determine the attribute that has the highest information gain on the training set.
Use this attribute as the root of the tree, create a branch for each of the values that the attribute can take.
For each of the branches, repeat this process with the subset of the training set that is classified by this branch.

ID3 Algorithm: Information Gain
Gain(S,A)=E(S)−∑v∈Values(A)∣Sv∣∣S∣E(Sv)\text{Gain}(S, A) = E(S) - \sum_{v \in \text{Values}(A)} \frac{|S_v|}{|S|} E(S_v)Gain(S,A)=E(S)−v∈Values(A)∑​∣S∣∣Sv​∣​E(Sv​)
Values(A): set of all possible values of attribute A.
Sᵥ: subset of S for which A has value v.
|S|: size of S; |Sᵥ|: size of Sᵥ.
The information gain Gain(S, A) is the expected reduction in entropy caused by knowing the value of the attribute A.

Naïve Bayes Classifier
Assumption: training set consists of instances described as conjunctions of attribute values, target classification based on a finite set of classes V.
The task of the learner is to predict the correct class for a new instance ⟨a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ⟩.
Key idea: assign most probable class vᵐᵃᵖ using Bayes Rule.
vMAP=arg maxvj∈VP(vj∣a1,a2,...,an)=arg maxvj∈VP(a1,...,an∣vj)P(vj)v_{\text{MAP}} = \underset{v_j \in V}{\text{arg max}} P(v_j | a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) = \underset{v_j \in V}{\text{arg max}} P(a_1, ..., a_n | v_j) P(v_j)vMAP​=vj​∈Varg max​P(vj​∣a1​,a2​,...,an​)=vj​∈Varg max​P(a1​,...,an​∣vj​)P(vj​)

Naïve Bayes Classifier (Continued)
Estimating P(vⱼ) is simple: compute the relative frequency of each target class in the training set.
Estimating P(a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ | vⱼ) is difficult: typically not enough instances for each attribute combination in the training set (sparse data problem).
Independence assumption: attribute values are conditionally independent given the target value: naive Bayes.
P(a1,...,an∣vj)=∏iP(ai∣vj)P(a_1, ..., a_n | v_j) = \prod_i P(a_i | v_j)P(a1​,...,an​∣vj​)=i∏​P(ai​∣vj​)
Final classifier:
vNB=arg maxvj∈VP(vj)∏iP(ai∣vj)v_{\text{NB}} = \underset{v_j \in V}{\text{arg max}} P(v_j) \prod_i P(a_i | v_j)vNB​=vj​∈Varg max​P(vj​)i∏​P(ai​∣vj​)

Linear Regression
Linear regression is a technique for numeric predictions that’s widely used in psychology, medical research, etc.
Key idea: find a linear equation that predicts the target value x from the attribute values a₁, ..., aₖ:
x=w0+w1a1+w2a2+...+wkakx = w_0 + w_1 a_1 + w_2 a_2 + ... + w_k a_kx=w0​+w1​a1​+w2​a2​+...+wk​ak​
Here, w₁, ..., wₖ are the regression coefficients, w₀ is called the intercept. These are the model parameters that need to be induced from the data set.

Linear Regression (Continued)
The regression equation computes the following predicted value xᵢ' for the i-th instance in the data set:
xi′=w0+w1a1,i+w2a2,i+...+wkak,i=w0+∑j=1kwjaj,ix_i' = w_0 + w_1 a_{1,i} + w_2 a_{2,i} + ... + w_k a_{k,i} = w_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{k} w_j a_{j,i}xi′​=w0​+w1​a1,i​+w2​a2,i​+...+wk​ak,i​=w0​+j=1∑k​wj​aj,i​
Key idea: determine coefficients w₀, ..., wₖ by minimizing the squared difference between predicted and actual values, summed over all instances in the data set:
e=∑i=1n(xi−xi′)2=∑i=1n(xi−w0−∑j=1kwjaj,i)2e = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - x_i')^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(x_i - w_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{k} w_j a_{j,i}\right)^2e=i=1∑n​(xi​−xi′​)2=i=1∑n​(xi​−w0​−j=1∑k​wj​aj,i​)2
The method for this is called Least Square Estimation (LSE).

The k-means Algorithm
Iterative, hard, flat clustering algorithm based on Euclidean distance.
Intuitive formulation:
Specify k, the number of clusters to be generated.
Choose k points at random as cluster centers.
Assign each instance to its closest cluster center using Euclidean distance.
Calculate the centroid (mean) for each cluster, use it as a new cluster center.
Reassign all instances to the closest cluster center.
Iterate until the cluster centers don’t change any more.

The k-means Algorithm (Continued)
Each instance x in the training set can be represented as a vector of n values, one for each attribute:
x⃗=(x1,x2,...,xn)\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)x=(x1​,x2​,...,xn​)
Euclidean distance between two vectors x and y:
∣x⃗−y⃗∣=∑i=1n(xi−yi)2|\vec{x} - \vec{y}| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}∣x−y​∣=i=1∑n​(xi​−yi​)2​
Mean μ of a set of vectors cⱼ:
μ⃗=1∣cj∣∑x⃗∈cjx⃗\vec{\mu} = \frac{1}{|c_j|} \sum_{\vec{x} \in c_j} \vec{x}μ​=∣cj​∣1​x∈cj​∑​x

Machine Learning
CHAPTER 7
How much machine learning do you actually need to know to land a top job in Silicon Valley or Wall Street? Probably less than you think! From coaching hundreds of data folks on the job hunt, one of the most common misconceptions we saw was candidates thinking their lack of deep learning expertise would tank their performance in data science interviews. However, the truth is that most data scientists are hired to solve business problems—not blindly throw complicated neural networks on top of dirty data. As such, a data scientist with strong business intuition can create more business value by applying linear regression in an Excel sheet than a script kiddie whose knowledge doesn’t extend beyond the Keras API.
So, unless you're interviewing for ML Engineering or Research Scientist roles, a solid understanding of the classical machine learning techniques covered in this chapter is all you need to ace the data science interview. However, if you are aiming for ML-heavy roles that do require advanced knowledge, this chapter will still be handy! Throughout this chapter, we frequently call attention to which topics and types of questions show up in tougher ML interviews. Plus, the 35 questions at the end of the chapter—especially the hard ones—will challenge even the most seasoned ML practitioner.

What to Expect for ML Interview Questions
When machine learning is brought up in an interview context, the problems fall into three major buckets:
Conceptual questions: Do you have a strong theoretical ML background?
Resume-driven questions: Have you actively applied ML before?
End-to-end modeling questions: Can you apply ML to a hypothetical business problem?

Conceptual Questions
Conceptual questions usually center around what different machine learning terms mean and how popular machine learning techniques operate. For example, two frequently asked questions are:
"What is the bias-variance tradeoff?"
"How does PCA work?"
To test your ability to communicate with non-technical stakeholders, a common twist on these conceptual questions is being asked to explain the answer as if the interviewer were a five-year-old (similar to Reddit's popular ELI5 subreddit).
Because many data science roles don’t require hardcore machine learning knowledge, easier, straightforward questions such as these represent the vast majority of questions you'd expect during a typical interview. Being asked easier ML questions is especially the case when interviewing for a data science role that’s more product- and business-analytics-oriented, as having to build models just isn’t part of the day-to-day work.
For ML-intensive positions like ML Engineer or Research Scientist, interviews also start with higher-level, easier conceptual questions but then push you to dive deeper into the details via follow-up questions. Companies do this to ensure you aren’t a "walking, talking ML buzzword generator." For example, as a follow-up to defining the bias-variance tradeoff, you might be asked to whiteboard the math behind the concept. Instead of simply asking how PCA (Principal Component Analysis) works, you might also be asked about the most common pitfalls of using PCA.
Since ML interviews are so expansive in scope, if asked about a particular technique you may not be overly familiar with, it’s perfectly okay to say, "I’ve read about it in the past. I don’t have any experience with these types of techniques, but I’m interested to learn more about them!" This signals honesty and an eagerness to learn (and don’t be ashamed to admit not knowing something—nobody knows all the techniques in detail!). Trust us, it's better than pretending you know the techniques and then falling apart when questions are asked.
If nothing on your resume seems interesting to an interviewer, but they still want to go deep into one ML topic, they may have you pick the topic. They do this by either asking:
"What’s your favorite ML algorithm?"
"What’s a model you use often and why?"
Consequently, it pays to have a deep understanding of at least a single technique—something you’ve actually used before and that’s listed on your resume.
Word of caution: Don’t choose something about a state-of-the-art transformer model to discuss as your favorite technique. Your details on it may be hazy, and your interviewer might not know enough about it to carry on a good conversation. You’re better off picking something fundamental yet interesting (to you) so that you and your interviewer can have a meaningful discussion. For example, your answer could be that you like random forests because they handle both classification and regression tasks with minimal preprocessing needed. Additionally, you both have projects on your resume to back up your interest in random forests.

Resume-Driven Questions
The next most common type of interview question for ML interviews is the resume-driven question. Resume-driven questions are often about showcasing that you have practical experience (as opposed to conceptual knowledge) As such, if you have job experience that is directly relevant, interviewers will often ask about that. If not, they’ll often fall back to asking about your projects.
Anything listed on your resume is fair game to be picked apart, and this is especially true for more ML-heavy roles. Because the field is so vast and continually evolving, an interviewer isn’t able to assess your fit for the job by asking about some niche topic unrelated to the position at hand. For example, say you are going for a general data science role—it’s not fair to ask a candidate about CNNs and their use in computer vision if they have no experience with this topic and it’s not relevant to the job. But, suppose you hacked together a self-driving toy car last summer, and listed it on your resume. In that case—even though the role at hand may not require computer vision—it’s totally fair game to be asked more about the neural network architecture you used, model training issues you faced, and tradeoffs you made versus other techniques. Plus, in an effort to see if you know the details not just of your project, but of the greater landscape, you’d also be expected to answer questions tangentially related to the project.

End-to-End Modeling Questions
Finally, the last type of ML-related problem you can expect during interviews are end-to-end modeling questions. Interviewers are testing your ability to go beyond the ML theory covered in books like An Introduction to Statistical Learning and actually apply what you learned to solve real-world problems. Examples of questions include:
"How would you match Uber drivers to riders?"
"How would you build a search autocomplete feature for Pinterest?"
While these open-ended problems are an interview staple for any machine-learning-heavy role, they also pop up during generalist data science interviews.
At the end of this chapter, we cover the end-to-end machine learning workflow, which can serve as a framework for answering these broad ML questions. We cover steps like problem definition, feature engineering, and performance metric selection—things you’d do before jumping into the various ML techniques we soon cover. To better solve these ML case study problems, we also recommend reading Chapter 11: Case Study Interview Questions to understand the non-ML-specific advice we offer for tackling open-ended problems.

The Math Behind Machine Learning
While the probability and statistics concepts upon which machine learning’s foundation is built are fair game for interviews, you’re less likely to be asked about the linear algebra and multivariable calculus concepts that underlie machine learning. There are, however, two notable exceptions:
If you’re interviewing for a research scientist position.
If you’re interviewing for quant finance.
In these cases, you may be expected to whiteboard proofs and derive formulas. For example, you could be asked to derive the least squares estimator in linear regression or explain how to calculate the principal components in PCA. Sometimes, to see how strong your first principles are, you’ll be given a math problem more indirectly. For instance, you could be asked to analyze the statistical factors driving portfolio returns (which essentially boils down to explaining the math behind PCA).
Regardless of the role and company, we still recommend you review the basics since understanding them will help you grasp the theoretical underpinnings of the techniques covered later in this chapter.

Linear Algebra
One linear algebra subtopic worth touching on for interviews is eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Mechanically, for some n×n matrix A, x is an eigenvector of A if : Ax=,where λ is a scalar.
A matrix can represent a linear transformation, and when applied to a vector xxx, results in another vector called an eigenvector, which has the same direction as x and is in fact x multiplied by a scaling factor λ known as an eigenvalue.
The decomposition of a square matrix into its eigenvectors is called an eigendecomposition. Not all matrices are square. Non-square matrices are decomposed using a method called singular value decomposition (SVD). A matrix to which SVD is applied has a decomposition of the form:
A=UΣVTA = U \Sigma V^TA=UΣVT
There are many applications of linear algebra in ML, ranging from matrix multiplications during backpropagation in neural networks to using eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix in PCA. As such, during technical interviews for ML engineering and quantitative finance roles, you should be able to whiteboard any follow-up questions on the linear algebra concepts underlying techniques like PCA and linear regression. Other linear algebra topics you're expected to know are core building blocks like vector spaces, projections, inverses, matrix transformations, determinants, orthonormality, and diagonalization.
Gradient Descent
Machine learning is concerned with minimizing some particular objective function (most commonly known as a loss or cost function). A loss function measures how well a particular model fits a given dataset, and the lower the cost, the more desirable. Techniques to optimize the loss function are known as optimization methods.
One popular optimization method is gradient descent, which takes small steps in the direction of the steepest descent for a particular objective function. It's akin to racing down a hill. To win, you always take a “next step” in the steepest direction downhill.
For convex functions, the gradient descent algorithm eventually finds the optimal point by updating the below equation until the value at the next iteration is very close to the current iteration (convergence):
xt+1=xt−α∇f(xt)x_{t+1} = x_t - \alpha \nabla f(x_t)xt+1​=xt​−α∇f(xt​)

Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization method in machine learning used to minimize an objective function, commonly referred to as a loss or cost function. The goal of minimizing the loss function is to improve how well a model fits a given dataset, with lower loss values being more desirable.
Gradient descent operates by iteratively taking small steps in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function. This process can be visualized as akin to racing downhill, where each step moves closer to the lowest point of the function, representing the optimal solution.
For convex functions, the gradient descent algorithm guarantees convergence to the optimal point. The iterative process is defined by the formula:
xt+1=xt−α∇f(xt)x_{t+1} = x_t - \alpha \nabla f(x_t)xt+1​=xt​−α∇f(xt​)
Here, α\alphaα represents the learning rate, which determines the step size at each iteration, and ∇f(xt)\nabla f(x_t)∇f(xt​) is the gradient of the function at the current point.
Gradient descent is widely used across various machine learning applications due to its simplicity and efficiency in finding optimal model parameters. Proper tuning of the learning rate and understanding the loss function are critical for ensuring successful optimization.
Since many cost functions in machine learning can be broken down into the sum of individual functions, the gradient step can be broken down into adding separate gradients. However, this process can be computationally expensive, and the algorithm may get stuck at a local minimum or saddle point. Therefore, we can use a version of gradient descent called stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which adds an element of randomness so that the gradient does not get stuck. SGD uses one data point at a time for a single step and employs a much smaller subset of data points at any given step but is nonetheless able to obtain an unbiased estimate of the true gradient. Alternatively, we can use batch gradient descent (BGD), which uses a fixed, small number (a mini-batch) of data points per step.
Gradient descent and SGD are popular topics for ML interviews since they are used to optimize the training of almost all machine learning methods. Besides the usual questions on the high-level concepts and mathematical details, you may be asked when you would want to use one or the other. You might even be asked to implement a basic version of SGD in a coding interview

Model Evaluation and Selection
With the math underlying machine learning techniques out of the way, how do we actually choose the best model for our problem or compare two models against each other? Model evaluation is the process of evaluating how well a model performs on the test set after it's been trained on the train set. Separating out your training data—usually 80% for the train set—from the 20% of the test set is essential because the usefulness of a model boils down to how good predictions are on data that has not been seen before.
Model selection, as the name implies, is the process of selecting which model to implement after each model has been evaluated. Both steps (evaluation and selection) are critical to get right because even tiny changes in model performance can lead to massive gains at big tech companies. For example, at Facebook, a model that can cause even a 0.1% lift in ad click-through rates can lead to $10+ million in extra revenue.
That's why in interviews, especially during case-study questions where you solve an open-ended problem, discussions often head toward comparing and contrasting models and selecting the most suitable one after factoring in business and product constraints. Thus, internalizing the concepts covered in this section is key to succeeding in ML interviews.

Bias-Variance Tradeoff
The bias-variance tradeoff is an interview classic and a key framework for understanding different kinds of models. With any model, we are usually trying to estimate a function f(x)f(x)f(x), which predicts our target variable yyy based on our input xxx. This relationship can be described as follows:
y=f(x)+w
where www is noise, not captured by f(x), and is assumed to be distributed as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable for certain regression problems. To assess how well the model fits, we can decompose the error of y into the following:
Bias: How close the model’s predicted values come to the true underlying f(x) values, with smaller being better.
Variance: The extent to which model prediction error changes based on training inputs, with smaller being better.
Irreducible error: Variation due to inherently noisy observation processes.

The bias-variance trade-off is a fundamental concept in machine learning that helps analyze and understand the behavior and performance of predictive models. It explains how models handle the complexities of data and the balance between underfitting and overfitting.
High Bias, Low Variance Models:
Models like linear regression fall into this category. These models are simple to implement and interpret but often oversimplify the problem. This situation, known as underfitting, occurs when the model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data. For instance, in predicting housing prices, a high bias model might consistently predict values that are far from the actual market prices. However, these predictions tend to exhibit low variability, meaning the results are consistently off by a similar margin. This reliability in errors comes at the cost of accuracy and flexibility.
Low Bias, High Variance Models:
On the other hand, models like neural networks, which are capable of capturing complex patterns, fall into this category. These models can make predictions that are closer to the true values on average, but their predictions might vary widely depending on the input data. This variability, known as high variance, often indicates overfitting. Overfitted models perform exceptionally well on training data but struggle to generalize to new, unseen data. In the context of housing prices, a low bias, high variance model might accurately capture market trends but produce erratic predictions due to its sensitivity to small changes in the input features.
Balancing Bias and Variance:
The goal in machine learning is to find a balance between bias and variance to achieve the best predictive performance. A model with too much bias fails to learn the data (underfitting), while a model with too much variance becomes overly tuned to the training data and fails to generalize (overfitting). Striking this balance ensures the model achieves both accuracy and generalizability, which are crucial for practical applications.
The concept of the bias-variance trade-off is often visualized using diagrams, where the interplay between error due to bias, variance, and irreducible noise is depicted. By analyzing this trade-off, data scientists can choose appropriate algorithms and fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
In summary, understanding and managing the bias-variance trade-off is critical in model selection and evaluation. High bias models are reliable but inaccurate, while high variance models are flexible but inconsistent. The objective is to develop a model that minimizes both errors, ensuring robust and reliable predictions.
While the bias-variance tradeoff equation occasionally shows up in data science interviews, more frequently, you'll be asked to reason about the bias-variance tradeoff given a specific situation. For example, presented with a model that has high variance, you could mention how you'd source additional data to fix the issue. Posed with a situation where the model has high bias, you could discuss how increasing the complexity of the model could help. By understanding the business and product requirements, you'll know how to make the bias-variance tradeoff for the interview problem posed.

Model Complexity and Overfitting
"All models are wrong, but some are useful" is a well-known adage, coined by statistician George Box. Ultimately, our goal is to discover a model that can generalize to learn some relationship with datasets. Occam's razor, applied to machine learning, suggests that simpler models are generally more useful and correct than more complicated models. That's because simpler, more parsimonious models tend to generalize better.
Said another way, simpler, smaller models are less likely to overfit (fit too closely to the training data). Overfit models tend not to generalize well out of sample. That's because during overfitting, the models pick up too much noise or random fluctuations using the training data, which hinders performance on data the model has never seen before.
  High Variance (Overfitting): The model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise and showing erratic predictions with poor generalization.
  High Bias (Underfitting): The model is too simple, failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in high errors.
  Low Bias, Low Variance (Good Balance): The model achieves an optimal balance, effectively capturing the true data pattern without overfitting or underfitting.Underfitting refers to the opposite case—the scenario where the model is not learning enough of the true relationship underlying the data. Because overfitting is so common in real-world machine learning, interviewers commonly ask you how you can detect it, and what you can do to avoid it, which brings us to our next topic: regularization.

Regularization
Regularization aims to reduce the complexity of models. In relation to the bias-variance tradeoff, regularization aims to decrease complexity in a way that significantly reduces variance while only slightly increasing bias. The most widely used forms of regularization are L1 and L2. Both methods add a simple penalty term to the objective function. The penalty helps shrink coefficients of features, which reduces overfitting. This is why, not surprisingly, they are also known as shrinkage methods.
Specifically:
L1 (also known as lasso): Uses the absolute value of a coefficient in the objective function as a penalty.
L2 (also known as ridge): Uses the squared magnitude of a coefficient in the objective function.
The L1 and L2 penalties can also be linearly combined, resulting in the popular form of regularization called elastic net. Since having models overfit is a prevalent problem in machine learning, it’s important to understand when to use each type of regularization. For example:
L1 serves as a feature selection method, as many coefficients shrink to 0 (are zeroed out) and are removed from the model.
L2 is less likely to shrink any coefficients to 0. Therefore, L1 leads to sparser models and is considered a stricter shrinkage operation.

Interpretability & Explainability
In Kaggle competitions and classwork, you might be expected to maximize a model's performance metric, like accuracy. However, in the real world, rather than just maximizing a particular metric, you might also be responsible for explaining how your model came up with that output. For example, if your model predicts that someone shouldn’t get a loan, doesn’t that person deserve to know why?
Broadly, interpretable models can help you identify biases in the model, which leads to more ethical AI. Plus, in some domains like healthcare, there can be deep auditing on decisions, and explainable models can help you stay compliant. However, there’s usually a tradeoff between performance and model interpretability. Often, using a more complex model might increase performance but make results harder to interpret.

Example Techniques for Interpretability:
Linear models: Feature importance is directly available as weights, which can be visualized and analyzed.
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPLanations): Uses Shapley values to denote the average marginal contribution of a feature over all possible combinations of inputs.
LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
LIME uses sparse linear models around various predictions to understand how any model performs in that local vicinity.
While it’s rare to be asked about the details of SHAP and LIME during interviews, having an understanding of why model interpretability matters, and bringing up this consideration in open-ended problems, is key.

Model Training
We’ve covered frameworks to evaluate models and selected the best-performing ones, but how do we actually train the model in the first place? If you don’t master the art of model training (i.e., teaching machines to learn), even the best machine learning techniques will fail.
Recall the basics:
First, train models on a training dataset, and then test the models on a testing dataset.
Normally, 80% of the data will go toward training, and 20% serves as the test set.
But, as we’ll soon cover, there’s much more to model training than the 80/20 train vs. test split.

Cross-Validation
Cross-validation assesses the performance of an algorithm on several subsamples of training data. It consists of running the algorithm on subsamples of the training data, such as the original data with some of the observations excluded, and evaluating model performance on the portion of the data that was excluded from the subsample.
This process is repeated multiple times for different subsamples, and the results are combined at the end.
Why is cross-validation important?
It helps avoid overfitting, particularly by ensuring the model doesn’t train and test on the same subsets of data.
In cases where data is limited or acquiring more is costly, cross-validation enables confidence in the model's consistency and quality.
K-Fold Cross-Validation:
One popular method for cross-validation is k-fold cross-validation, which works as follows:
Randomly shuffle the data into equally sized blocks (folds).
For each fold iii:
Train the model on all data except fold iii.
Evaluate the validation error using block iii.
Average the k validation errors from step 2 to estimate the true error.

Another form of cross-validation you should know is leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV).
LOOCV is a special case of k-fold cross-validation where k equals the size of the dataset (n).
The model tests on every single data point during validation.
In the case of larger datasets, cross-validation can become computationally expensive because every fold is used for evaluation. In this case, it can be better to use a train-validation split, where the data is divided into three parts: a training set, a dedicated validation set (also known as a “dev” set), and a test set. The validation set usually ranges from 10% to 20% of the entire dataset.
An interview question that comes up from time to time is how to apply cross-validation for time-series data. Standard k-fold cross-validation can’t be applied since the time-series data is not randomly distributed but instead is already in chronological order. Therefore, you should not use data “in the future” for predicting data “from the past.” Instead, you should use historical data up until a given point in time and vary that point in time from the beginning to the end.

Bootstrapping and Bagging
The process of bootstrapping is simply drawing observations from a large data sample repeatedly (sampling with replacement) and estimating some quantity of a population by averaging estimates from multiple smaller samples. Besides being useful in cases where the dataset is small, bootstrapping is also useful for helping deal with class imbalance. For the classes that are rare, we can generate new samples via bootstrapping.
Another common application of bootstrapping is in ensemble learning, which involves averaging estimates from many smaller models into a main model. Each individual model is created using a particular sample from the process. This method of bootstrap aggregation is also known as bagging. Ensemble methods like random forests, AdaBoost, and XGBoost are industry favorites, and interviewers tend to ask questions about bootstrapping and ensemble learning. For example, one of the most common interview questions is: “What is the difference between XGBoost and a random forest?”

Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameters are important because they impact a model’s training time, compute resources needed (and hence cost), and ultimately performance. One popular method for tuning hyperparameters is grid search, which involves forming a grid that is the Cartesian product of those parameters and then sequentially trying all such combinations to see which yields the best results. While comprehensive, this method can take a long time to run since the cost increases exponentially with the number of hyperparameters. Another popular hyperparameter tuning method is random search, where a distribution is defined for each parameter, and values are randomly sampled from the joint distribution of all parameters. This solves the problem of exploring an exponentially increasing search space but is not necessarily guaranteed to achieve an optimal result. While not generally asked about in data science interviews for research scientist or machine learning engineering roles, hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization might be brought up. This discussion mostly happens in the context of neural networks, random forests, or XGBoost. For interviews, you should be able to list a couple of hyperparameters for your favorite modeling technique and explain their impact on generalization.

Training Times and Learning Curves
Training time is another factor to consider when it comes to model selection, especially for exceedingly large datasets. As explained later in the coding chapter, it’s possible to use big-O notation to clarify theoretical bounds on training time for each algorithm. These training time estimates are based on the number of data points and the dimensionality of the data.
For real-life training ML models, you should also factor in training time considerations and resource constraints during model selection. While you can always train more complex models and achieve marginally higher model performance metrics, the tradeoff versus increased resource usage and training time might make such a decision suboptimal.
Learning curves are plots of model learning performance over time. The y-axis is some metric of learning (for example, classification accuracy), and the x-axis is experience (time).
The figure shows the loss values for both training and validation datasets over multiple iterations of a machine learning model's training process. Initially, both losses decrease as the model learns, but after a point, the validation loss stops improving and fluctuates while the training loss continues to decline. This behavior indicates that the model may be overfitting, as it performs better on the training data but does not generalize as well to the validation data.
A popular data science interview question involving learning curves is “How would you identify if your model was overfitting?” By analyzing the learning curves, you should be able to spot whether a model is underfitting or overfitting. For example, above, you can see that as the number of iterations is increasing, the training error is getting better. However, the validation error is not improving—in fact, it is increasing at the end—a clear sign that the model is overfitting and training can be stopped. Additionally, learning curves should help you discover whether a dataset is representative or not. If the data was not representative, the plot would show a large gap between the training curve and validation curve, which doesn’t get smaller even as training time increases.

Linear Regression
Linear regression is a form of supervised learning, where a model is trained on labeled input data. Linear regression is one of the most popular methods employed in machine learning and has many real-life applications due to its quick runtime and interpretability. That’s why there’s the joke about regression to regression: where you try to solve a problem with more advanced methods but keep falling back to tried and true linear regression.
As such, linear regression questions are asked in all types of data science and machine learning interviews. Essentially, interviewers are trying to make sure your knowledge goes beyond just calling linear_regression from sci-kit learn and then blindly calling linear_regression.fit(X, Y) . That’s why deep knowledge of linear regression—understanding its assumptions, addressing edge cases, and knowing its real-world scenarios,and knowning the different evaluation metrics —will set you apart from others candidates.
In real-life scenarios, knowing the different evaluation metrics will set you apart from other candidates.
In linear regression, the goal is to estimate a function f(x), such that each feature has a linear relationship to the target variable y, or:
y=Xβ
where X is a matrix of predictor variables, and β is a vector of parameters that determines the weight of each variable in predicting the target variable. So, how do you compare the performance of two linear regression models?

Evaluating Linear Regression
The evaluation of a regression model is built on the concept of a residual: the distance between what the model predicted versus the actual value. Linear regression estimates β\betaβ by minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS), which is given by the following:
RSS(β)=(y−Xβ)T(y−Xβ)Two other sum of squares concepts to know besides the RSS are the total sum of squares (TSS) and the explained sum of squares (ESS). The total sum of squares is the combined variation in the data (TSS=ESS+RSSTSS = ESS + RSSTSS=ESS+RSS). The explained sum of squares is the difference between TSS and RSS.
A popular metric for assessing goodness-of-fit is R2R^2R2, which is given by:
R2=1−RSSTSSR^2 = 1 - \frac{RSS}{TSS}R2=1−TSSRSS​
It ranges between zero and one and represents the proportion of variability in the data explained by the model.
Other prominent error metrics to measure the goodness-of-fit of linear regression are MSE (mean squared error) and MAE (mean absolute error). MSE measures the variance of the residuals, whereas MAE measures the average of the residuals. Hence, MSE penalizes larger errors more than MAE, making it more sensitive to outliers.

The figure illustrates the relationship between actual and predicted values in a regression analysis. It includes three key components:
Regression Line: The line represents the predicted values based on the regression model. It minimizes the error between actual and predicted values.
Mean Line: This line represents the average of all observed values, serving as a baseline for comparison.
Residuals and Variance:
ESS (Explained Sum of Squares): The variance explained by the regression line, indicating how well the model fits the data.
RSS (Residual Sum of Squares): The variance not explained by the regression model, representing the error or unexplained random variance.

The graph shows the "Actual vs Predicted Values" from a dummy dataset:
RSS: Represents unexplained random variance.
ESS: Represents explained variance.
The regression line highlights the predicted relationship between variables.
This visualization helps in understanding the variance and errors within a linear regression model.
Subset Selection
So, how do you reduce the model complexity of a regression model? Subset selection. By default, you use all the predictors in a linear model. However, in practice, it’s important to narrow down the number of features and only include the most important ones. One way is best subset selection, which tries each model with k predictors, out of p possible ones, where k<pk < pk<p. Then, you choose the best subset model using a regression metric like R2R^2R2. While this guarantees the best result, it can be computationally infeasible as ppp increases (due to the exponential number of combinations that must be tested). Additionally, by trying every option in a large search space, you’re likely to get a model that overfits, with a high variance in coefficient estimates.
Therefore, an alternative is to use stepwise selection. In forward stepwise selection, we start with an empty model and iteratively add the most useful predictor. In backward stepwise selection, we start with the full model and iteratively remove the least useful predictor. While doing stepwise selection, we aim to find a model with high R2R^2R2, low RSS, and minimal predictors, while considering metrics like AIC or adjusted R2R^2R2.

Linear Regression Assumptions
Because linear regression is one of the most commonly applied models, it has the honor of also being one of the most misapplied models. Before you can use this technique, you must validate its four main assumptions to prevent erroneous results:
Linearity: The relationship between the feature set and the target variable is linear.
Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant.
Independence: All observations are independent of one another.
Normality: The distribution of residuals is assumed to be normal.
These assumptions are crucial to know. For example, in the figure that follows, there are four linear regression fits that demonstrate best-fit lines that are the same. However, only in the top-left dataset are these four assumptions met.


The images display four datasets with different patterns in their data, each fitted with the same linear regression line. These figures are often used to illustrate Anscombe's Quartet, demonstrating the importance of visualizing data rather than relying solely on summary statistics.
First Plot (Top Left):
A linear relationship is apparent, and the linear regression line fits the data well.
The data points are evenly distributed around the regression line.
Second Plot (Top Right):
The data follows a nonlinear relationship, forming a curve.
The linear regression line does not capture the underlying pattern well.
Third Plot (Bottom Left):
The data is mostly linear but contains an outlier that significantly influences the regression line.
This shows how a single outlier can distort the line of best fit.
Fourth Plot (Bottom Right):
Most of the data points are tightly clustered, with one extreme outlier far from the others.
The regression line is influenced by the outlier, resulting in a poor fit for the majority of the data.
Key Insight:
Although these datasets share similar statistical properties (e.g., mean, variance, and correlation), their underlying patterns differ significantly. This emphasizes the necessity of visual data exploration to ensure appropriate analysis and model selection.

Note: For the independence and normality assumption, the use of the term "i.i.d." (independent and identically distributed) is also common. If any of these assumptions are violated, any forecasts or confidence intervals based on the model will most likely be misleading or biased. As a result, the linear regression model will likely perform poorly out of sample.

Avoiding Linear Regression Pitfalls
Heteroscedasticity
Linear regression assumes that the residuals (the distance between what the model predicted versus the actual value) are identically distributed. If the variance of the residuals is not constant, then heteroscedasticity is most likely present, meaning that the residuals are not identically distributed.
To identify heteroscedasticity, you can plot the residuals versus the fitted values. If the relationship between residuals and fitted values shows a nonlinear pattern, this indicates that you should try to transform the dependent variable or include nonlinear terms in the model.
 
he figure illustrates an example of heteroscedasticity, a condition in regression analysis where the variance of the residuals (errors) is not constant across all levels of the independent variable.
Explanation:
As the value of the independent variable (x) increases, the spread of the residuals (dots) grows larger.
This indicates that the variability of the errors is increasing with higher values of x.
The regression line attempts to fit the data, but the non-constant variance violates one of the key assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, which assumes homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals).

Another useful diagnostic plot is the scale-location plot, which plots standardized residuals versus the fitted values. If the data shows heteroscedasticity, you will not see a horizontal line with equally spread points.

Normality
Linear regression assumes the residuals are normally distributed. We can test this through a QQ plot. Also known as a quantile plot, a QQ plot graphs the standardized residuals versus theoretical quantiles and shows whether the residuals appear to be normally distributed (i.e., the plot resembles a straight line).
If the QQ-plot is not a reasonably straight line, this is a sign that the residuals are not normally distributed, and hence, the model should be reexamined. In that case, transforming the dependent variable (with a log or square-root transformation, for example) can help reduce skew.

The figure shows Normal Q-Q Plots, which are used to assess whether a dataset follows a normal distribution. The x-axis represents the theoretical quantiles (expected values if the data were normal), and the y-axis represents the sample quantiles (actual data). Here's what each plot depicts:

The points deviate from the diagonal line at the extremes, indicating fewer extreme values (light tails) compared to a normal distribution.
Left-Skewed (Top Right):
The points form a curve deviating below the diagonal line, indicating a left-skewed distribution where the data has a longer tail on the left.
Normal (Bottom Left):
The points fall almost perfectly on the diagonal line, suggesting the data closely follows a normal distribution.
Bimodal (Bottom Right):
The points deviate from the diagonal in a systematic pattern, indicating a bimodal distribution (two peaks in the data).
Key Insight:
Q-Q plots visually compare the observed data to a theoretical normal distribution. Deviations from the diagonal line indicate departures from normality, helping identify skewness, kurtosis, or multimodality in the data.

Outliers
Outliers can have an outsized impact on regression results. There are several ways to identify outliers. One of the more popular methods is examining Cook’s distance, which estimates the influence of any given data point. Cook’s distance takes into account the residual and leverage (how far away the XXX-value differs from that of other observations) of every point. In practice, it can be useful to remove points with a Cook’s distance value above a certain threshold.

Multicollinearity
Another pitfall is if the predictors are correlated. This phenomenon, known as multicollinearity, affects the resulting coefficient estimates by making it problematic to distinguish the true underlying individual weights of variables. Multicollinearity is most commonly observed by weights that flip magnitude. It is one of the reasons why model weights cannot be directly interpreted as the importance of a feature in linear regression. Features that initially would appear to be independent variables can often be highly correlated. For example, the number of Instagram posts made and the number of notifications received are most likely highly correlated, since both are related to user activity on the platform, and one generally causes another.
One way to assess multicollinearity is by examining the variance inflation factor (VIF), which quantifies how much the estimated coefficients are inflated when multicollinearity exists. Methods to address multicollinearity include removing the correlated variables, linearly combining the variables, or using PCA/PLS (partial least squares).

Confounding Variables
Multicollinearity is an extreme case of confounding, which occurs when a variable (but not the main independent or dependent variables) affects the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. This can cause invalid correlations. For example, say you were studying the effects of ice cream consumption on sunburns and found that higher ice cream consumption leads to a higher likelihood of sunburn. That would be an incorrect conclusion because temperature is the confounding variable—higher summer temperatures lead to people eating more ice cream and also spending more time outdoors (which leads to more sunburn).
Confounding can occur in many other ways too. For example, one way is selection bias, where the data are biased due to the way they were collected (e.g., group imbalance). Another problem, known as omitted variable bias, occurs when important variables are omitted, resulting in a linear regression model that is biased and inconsistent. Omitted variables can stem from dataset generation issues or choices made during modeling. A common way to handle confounding is stratification. process where you create multiple categories or subgroups in which the confounding variables do not vary much, and then test significance and strength of associations using chi-squared, is critical.
Knowing about these regression edge cases, how to identify them, and how to guard against them is crucial. This knowledge separates the seasoned data scientists from the data neophyte—precisely why it’s such a popular topic for data science interviews.
Generalized Linear Models
In linear regression, the residuals are assumed to be normally distributed. The generalized linear model (GLM) is a generalization of linear regression that allows for the residuals to not just be normally distributed. For example, if Tinder wanted to predict the number of matches somebody would get in a month, they would likely want to use a GLM like the one below with a Poisson response (called Poisson regression) instead of a standard linear regression. The three common components to any GLM are:
Link Function
Systematic Component
Random Component
ln λₐ = β₀ + β₁xₐ
yₐ ∼ Poisson(λₐ)
Random Component: is the distribution of the error term, i.e., normal distribution for linear regression.
Systematic Component: is the explanatory variables, i.e., the predictors combined in a linear combination.
Link Function: is the link between the random and system components, i.e., a linear regression, logit regression, etc.
Note that in GLMs, the response variable is still a linear combination of weights and predictors.
Regression can also use the weights and predictors nonlinearly; the most common examples of this are polynomial regressions, splines, and general additive models. While interesting, these techniques are rarely asked about in interviews and thus are beyond the scope of this book.
Classification
General Framework
Interview questions related to classification algorithms are commonly asked during interviews due to the abundance of real-life applications for assigning categories to things. For example, classifying users as likely to churn or not, predicting whether a person will click on an ad or not, and distinguishing fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones are all applications of the classification techniques we mention in this section.
The goal of classification is to assign a given data point to one of KKK possible classes instead of calculating a continuous value (as in regression). The two types of classification models are generative models and discriminative models. Generative models deal with the joint distribution of XXX and YYY, which is defined as follows:
p(X,Y)=p(Y∣X)p(X)
Maximizing a posterior probability distribution produces decision boundaries between classes where the resulting posterior probability is equivalent. The second type of model is discriminative. It determines a decision boundary by choosing the class that maximizes the probability.
y∗=argkmax​p(Y=k∣X)
Thus, both methods choose a predicted class that maximizes the posterior probability distribution; the difference is simply the approach. While traditional classification deals with just two classes (0 or 1), multi-class classification is common, and many of the below methods can be adapted to handle multiple labels.

Evaluating Classifiers
Before we detail the various classification algorithms like logistic regression and Naive Bayes, it’s essential to understand how to evaluate the predictive power of a classification model.
Say you are trying to predict whether an individual has a rare cancer that only happens to 1 in 10,000 people. By default, you could simply predict that every person doesn’t have cancer and be accurate 99.99% of the time. But clearly, this isn’t a helpful model—Pfizer won’t be acquiring our diagnostic test anytime soon! Given imbalanced classes, assessing accuracy alone is not enough—this is known as the “accuracy paradox” and is the reason why it’s critical to look at other measures for misclassified observations.

Building and Interpreting a Confusion Matrix
When building a classifier, we want to minimize the number of misclassified observations, which in binary cases can be termed false positives and false negatives.
In a false positive, the model incorrectly predicts that an instance belongs to the positive class. For the cancer detection example, a false positive means classifying an individual as having cancer when, in reality, the person does not have it.
On the other hand, a false negative occurs when the model incorrectly produces a negative class. In the cancer diagnostic case, this would mean saying a person doesn’t have cancer when, in fact, they do.
A confusion matrix helps organize and visualize this information. Each row represents the actual number of observations in a class, and each column represents the number of observations predicted as belonging to a class.


Precision and Recall
Two metrics that go beyond accuracy are precision and recall. In classification, precision is the actual positive proportion of observations that were predicted positive by the classifier. In the cancer diagnostic example, it’s the percentage of people you said would have cancer who actually ended up having the disease.
Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the percentage of total positive cases captured out of all positive cases. It’s essentially how well you do in finding people with cancer.
Precision vs. Recall Tradeoff
In real-world modeling, there’s a natural tradeoff between optimizing for precision or recall. For example, having high recall—catching most people who have cancer—ends up saving the lives of some people with the disease. However, this often leads to misdiagnosing others who don’t truly have cancer, which subjects healthy people to undergo costly and dangerous treatments like chemotherapy for a cancer they never had.
On the flip side, having high precision means being confident that when the diagnostic comes back positive, the person really has cancer. However, this often means missing some people who truly have the disease. These patients with missed diagnoses may gain a false sense of security, and their cancer, left unchecked, could lead to fatal outcomes.
During interviews, be prepared to talk about the precision versus recall tradeoff. For open-ended questions and take-home challenges, be sure to contextualize the business and product impact of a false positive or a false negative. In cases where both precision and recall are equally important, you can optimize the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:
F1=2*(precision*recallprecision)/(precision+recall)

Visualizing Classifier Performance
Besides precision, recall, and the F1 score, another popular way to evaluate classifiers is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate versus the false positive rate for various thresholds. The area under the curve (AUC) measures how well the classifier separates classes.
The AUC of the ROC curve is between zero and one, and a higher number means the model performs better in separating the classes. The most optimal curve is one that "hugs" the top-left corner of the plot. This indicates that the model has a high true-positive rate and relatively low false-positive rate.

The figure represents a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve, which is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model.
Explanation:
Axes:
X-axis: False Positive Rate (FPR), representing the proportion of negative cases incorrectly classified as positive.
Y-axis: True Positive Rate (TPR), also known as sensitivity or recall, representing the proportion of positive cases correctly classified.
Curves:
Random Classifier (Diagonal Line): Represents the performance of a model that makes random predictions, with no discriminatory power. It has an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.5.
Perfect Classifier (Top Left Corner): An ideal model with perfect predictions, where the curve reaches (0,1) immediately, achieving an AUC of 1.0.
Intermediate Curves: Represent the performance of actual classifiers. The closer a curve is to the top left corner, the better the model.
Key Insight:
The ROC Curve helps compare classifiers by showing the trade-off between TPR and FPR across different thresholds.
The AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a quantitative measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes. Higher AUC values indicate better classification performance.

Logistic Regression
One of the most popular classification algorithms is logistic regression, and it is asked about almost as frequently as linear regression during interviews. In logistic regression, a linear output is converted into a probability between 0 and 1 using the sigmoid function:
S(x)=1+e−xβ1​​
In the equation above, X is the set of predictor features and β is the corresponding vector of weights. Computing S(x) above produces a probability that indicates if an observation should be classified as a "1" (if the calculated probability is at least 0.5), and a "0" otherwise.
P(Y^=1∣X)=S(Xβ)

The loss function for logistic regression, also known as log-loss, is formulated as follows:
L(ω)=i=1∑n​yi​log(S(Xβ)1​)+(1−yi​)log(1−S(Xβ)1​)
Note that in cases where more than two outcome classes exist, softmax regression is a commonly used technique that generalizes logistic regression.
In practice, logistic regression, much like its cousin linear regression, is often used because it is highly interpretable: its output, a predicted probability, is easy to explain to decision makers. Additionally, its quickness to compute and ease of use often make it the first model employed for classification problems in a business context.
Note, however, that logistic regression does not work well under certain circumstances. Its relative simplicity makes it a high-bias and low-variance model, and so, it may not perform well when the decision boundary is not linear. Additionally, when features are highly correlated, the coefficients β won’t be as accurate. To address these cases, you can use techniques similar to those used in linear regression (regularization, removal of features, etc.) for dealing with this issue. For interviews, it is critical to understand both the mechanics and pitfalls of logistic regression.

Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers require only a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary parameters. They can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods (such as support vector machines). These advantages lead to Naive Bayes being a popularly used first technique in modeling, and is why this type of classifier shows up in interviews.
Naive Bayes uses Bayes’ rule (covered in Chapter 6: Statistics Interview Questions) and a set of conditional independence assumptions in order to learn P(Y∣X). There are two assumptions to know about Naive Bayes:
  Assumptions of Naive Bayes:
Each feature XiX_iXi​ is conditionally independent of any other feature XjX_jXj​, given the class label YYY.
All features are assigned equal weight.
  Simplification Through Independence:
The conditional independence assumption decouples the feature distributions, allowing each feature to be modeled independently as a one-dimensional distribution: P(X1,X2,…,Xn∣Y)=∏i=1nP(Xi∣Y)P(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n | Y) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(X_i | Y)P(X1​,X2​,…,Xn​∣Y)=i=1∏n​P(Xi​∣Y)
  Classification Rule:
By applying Bayes' theorem, the classifier selects the class YYY that maximizes: y^=arg⁡max⁡yP(Y=y)∏i=1nP(Xi∣Y=y)\hat{y} = \arg \max_y P(Y = y) \prod_{i=1}^n P(X_i | Y = y)y^​=argymax​P(Y=y)i=1∏n​P(Xi​∣Y=y)
  Efficiency in High-Dimensional Data:
In machine learning models with kkk features, the number of possible feature interactions grows exponentially (2k2^k2k), requiring vast data for effective modeling.
The independence assumption in Naive Bayes reduces this requirement to just kkk data points, making it computationally efficient.
  Applications:
Commonly used in tasks like text classification (e.g., spam detection and sentiment analysis), where predictors (e.g., words) are generally independent.
  Limitations:
The independence assumption rarely holds true in real-world data, as features often exhibit correlations.
Despite this limitation, Naive Bayes performs well in practice, especially when the data is linearly separable.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Support Vector Machines Overview
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a supervised learning method widely used for classification and regression problems. The central goal of SVMs is to identify a hyperplane that best separates data points into distinct classes, maximizing the margin between them. The margin is the minimum distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points, known as support vectors.

Key Points in the Content
1. Hyperplane and Margin in SVMs
The hyperplane is a decision boundary that separates data points belonging to different classes. In SVM, the objective is to choose the hyperplane with the maximum margin.
Support vectors are the data points nearest to the hyperplane. These points are crucial as they determine the position and orientation of the hyperplane.
Unlike models like logistic regression, the decision boundaries of SVMs can be non-linear if a non-linear kernel function is applied.
2. Linear and Non-linear Separability
When data is linearly separable, SVM identifies a straight hyperplane that effectively partitions the data.
For non-linear separable data, SVM applies a kernel trick to transform the input space into a higher-dimensional feature space. This enables the SVM to find a hyperplane that can separate the classes in the transformed space.
3. Kernel Function and Feature Mapping
A kernel function computes the dot product in the transformed feature space without explicitly mapping data to that space.
Mathematically: k(x,y)=ϕ(x)Tϕ(y)k(x, y) = \phi(x)^T \phi(y)k(x,y)=ϕ(x)Tϕ(y)
Common kernels:
Linear Kernel: Used for linearly separable data.
Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel and Gaussian Kernel: Used for non-linear data.
The kernel transformation enables SVM to handle complex decision boundaries in tasks where linear models would fail.
4. Applications of SVMs
SVMs are widely used in high-dimensional spaces, where the number of features exceeds the number of data points.
Example applications include:
Image classification
Text categorization
Bioinformatics (e.g., protein classification)
5. Advantages of SVM
Effective in high-dimensional spaces and suitable for datasets with many features.
Works well with both linear and non-linear data due to its flexibility with kernel functions.
Robust to overfitting, especially when the dataset has a clear margin of separation.
6. Limitations of SVM
Computational complexity increases with large datasets, making SVM less practical for very large datasets.
When classes overlap significantly or the data is not separable, SVM performance degrades.
SVM does not provide probabilistic outputs directly, unlike models such as logistic regression, which makes interpretation less intuitive.
7. Choosing SVM in Practice
SVM is preferred when:
The dataset is small but has high-dimensional features.
Non-linear decision boundaries are required, and the kernel trick can provide the necessary transformation.
SVM is less suitable for problems requiring interpretability or when computational resources are limited.

Insights from the Visualization
The image illustrates the concept of finding a hyperplane with the maximum margin, ensuring optimal separation between classes.
Another graphic depicts the kernel transformation, showing how data that is not separable in the original input space can become separable in a higher-dimensional feature space.
Decision Trees
Introduction to Decision Trees
Decision Trees are a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Their structure resembles a flowchart, where:
Each node represents a feature (attribute).
Each branch represents a decision rule.
Each leaf node represents an outcome or prediction.
In the Titanic example, a decision tree is used to classify passengers as either survivors or non-survivors based on attributes like gender, age, and family status (e.g., siblings/spouses aboard).

Training Process of Decision Trees
Greedy and Recursive Splitting:
Decision Trees are built in a recursive manner, starting from the root node and splitting the dataset based on features.
At each split, the algorithm chooses the feature that provides the most significant reduction in uncertainty or error (e.g., using metrics like entropy or Gini impurity).
Binary Splits:
The tree divides the data into two groups at each node based on a feature threshold. For example:
If gender is male, move to the left branch; otherwise, move to the right.
If age is less than 95, move to the left branch, and so on.
Stopping Criteria:
Splitting stops when:
A pure subset (all data points belong to the same class) is achieved.
A maximum tree depth is reached.
The number of data points in a node becomes too small.

Titanic Example: Predicting Passenger Survival
The decision tree displayed in the image focuses on classifying Titanic passengers based on survival:
Root Node: Gender
The first decision point splits passengers into male and female groups.
Intermediate Nodes: Age and Family Status
For males:
Passengers aged under 95 are further split based on the number of siblings/spouses aboard.
For females:
The survival chances might be higher and depend on other attributes (not fully visible in the image).

Advantages of Decision Trees
Interpretability:
Decision Trees are easy to visualize and understand, making them suitable for use cases requiring interpretability.
Non-parametric Nature:
They make no assumptions about the underlying data distribution, making them versatile for different types of data.

Challenges and Limitations
Overfitting:
Trees can grow too deep, leading to overfitting on training data. Techniques like pruning are used to mitigate this.
Bias Towards Features with More Levels:
Decision Trees may favor features with many distinct values (e.g., IDs) over more informative ones.

Summary
Decision Trees are versatile models that split data in a recursive and greedy manner to minimize error in classification or regression tasks. In the Titanic survival example, features like gender, age, and family relationships are used to predict survival outcomes. These models are easy to interpret and implement, making them a common choice in data science tasks, especially when simplicity and transparency are important.
Entropy
Definition: Measures the uncertainty or impurity in a dataset.
Formula: H(Y)=−∑k=1kP(Y=k)log⁡P(Y=k)H(Y) = - \sum_{k=1}^{k} P(Y = k) \log P(Y = k)H(Y)=−k=1∑k​P(Y=k)logP(Y=k)
High Entropy: Occurs when data is uniformly distributed (high uncertainty).
Low Entropy: Occurs when data is dominated by one class (low uncertainty).
Information Gain (IG)
Definition: The reduction in entropy achieved by splitting on a feature.
Formula: IG(Y,X)=H(Y)−H(Y∣X)IG(Y, X) = H(Y) - H(Y | X)IG(Y,X)=H(Y)−H(Y∣X)
Key Idea: Higher information gain indicates a better feature for splitting the data.
Usage in Decision Trees
Entropy quantifies the uncertainty before splitting.
Information Gain evaluates how much uncertainty is reduced by splitting on a feature.
The feature with the highest IGIGIG is selected for the split.
Key Insights
Decision trees split data recursively by maximizing information gain.
Entropy and IGIGIG guide the tree to reduce impurity and improve classification.
Random Forest Overview
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting. It works by aggregating the predictions of many individual decision trees.

Key Concepts
Overfitting in Decision Trees:
Individual decision trees are prone to overfitting because they may create overly specific splits for small subsets of data.
How Random Forest Reduces Overfitting:
Bagging: Random Forest uses bootstrap aggregating (bagging), where multiple decision trees are trained on random subsets of the data. The final prediction is an average of all trees (for regression) or a majority vote (for classification).
Feature Randomization: At each split, only a random subset of features is considered, preventing dominant features from appearing in all trees.

Advantages of Random Forests
Versatility: Effective for both classification and regression tasks.
Interpretability: Feature importance can be calculated to understand the influence of each variable.
Improved Accuracy: Reduces variance by averaging predictions, leading to better out-of-sample performance.
Scalability: Trees can be trained in parallel, making Random Forest computationally efficient.

When to Use Random Forests
When decision trees overfit the data.
When interpretability of feature importance is required.
For quick predictions with robust performance across various datasets.
Boosting Overview
Boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple "weak" models (e.g., shallow decision trees) sequentially. Each model corrects the weaknesses of its predecessor by focusing more on the data points that were misclassified or difficult to predict.

Key Concepts
Sequential Learning:
Models are trained one after another, with each new model correcting the errors of the previous one.
Weighted Data:
Each data point is assigned a weight. Points that are misclassified in one iteration are given higher weights in the next, ensuring more focus on difficult cases.
Risk of Overfitting:
Boosting can lead to overfitting, especially on noisy datasets, as it emphasizes harder-to-predict points.

Popular Boosting Techniques
1. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):
Combines multiple weak learners (e.g., decision trees with a single split).
Initial weights are uniformly distributed, but in subsequent iterations, misclassified points are re-weighted.
The final prediction is made by combining the weighted predictions of all classifiers.
2. Gradient Boosting:
A generalization of AdaBoost, where the focus is on minimizing the loss function by fitting new models to the residual errors of previous models.
Weights are adjusted based on the gradient of the loss function.
3. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):
An optimized implementation of gradient boosting with faster execution and better performance.
It uses advanced techniques like regularization to reduce overfitting and supports parallel computing.

Boosting vs. Random Forest
Boosting: Sequential, focuses on reducing bias, builds models iteratively.
Random Forest: Parallel, focuses on reducing variance, builds models independently.

Use Cases
Classification and regression tasks where high accuracy is required.
Commonly used in competitions (e.g., Kaggle) due to its robust performance.
Dimensionality Reduction
Definition: A technique to reduce the number of features (dimensions) in a dataset while retaining as much important information as possible.
Why Needed:
High-dimensional datasets are sparse, leading to the curse of dimensionality (data points are far apart and patterns are hard to identify).
Computational challenges with large datasets make it hard to process or visualize data.
Solutions:
Feature Selection: Removing redundant or highly correlated features.
Dimensionality Reduction: Transforming the dataset into a lower-dimensional space (e.g., projecting data into 2D or 3D).

Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
What It Does:
Combines highly correlated features into a smaller set of uncorrelated components called principal components.
Captures most of the variance in the data using fewer features.
How It Works:
Finds linear combinations of features that explain the maximum variance.
The first principal component explains the highest variance, followed by the second, and so on.
Projects the data into a smaller set of dimensions (e.g., kkk) that explain most of the variance.
Mathematical Objective: PCA finds the weight vector www that maximizes:
yi=wTX=∑j=1pwjXjy_i = w^T X = \sum_{j=1}^p w_j X_jyi​=wTX=j=1∑p​wj​Xj​
Subject to:
yiy_iyi​ is uncorrelated with other components.
Variance var(yi)\text{var}(y_i)var(yi​) is maximized.

Applications:
Data visualization by reducing dimensions to 2D or 3D.
Preprocessing step for machine learning to reduce computational complexity and improve model performance.

Key Insights for Interviews:
Curse of Dimensionality: Understand why high-dimensional data can hinder analysis.
PCA Trade-offs:
Assumes linear relationships between variables.
Sensitive to data scaling; features must be standardized.
Comparison to t-SNE:
PCA is deterministic and linear.
t-SNE is non-linear and often used for visualizing complex structures.
Clustering
Definition: Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters without labeled training data.
Purpose:
Discover hidden patterns or groupings in data.
Applications include customer segmentation, fraud detection, anomaly detection, and data visualization.

Key Properties of Clusters
Intra-cluster Similarity: Points within the same cluster are similar to each other.
Inter-cluster Dissimilarity: Points in different clusters are dissimilar to each other.

K-Means Clustering
How it Works:
Partition data into k distinct clusters.
Assign points to the nearest cluster centroid, update centroids, and repeat until convergence.
Objective: Minimize total intra-cluster variation.
L=∑j=1k∑x∈Sj∣∣x−μj∣∣2L = \sum_{j=1}^k \sum_{x \in S_j} ||x - \mu_j||^2L=j=1∑k​x∈Sj​∑​∣∣x−μj​∣∣2
Advantages:
Easy to implement.
Works well for spherical, evenly-sized clusters.
Limitations:
Requires the number of clusters (kkk) to be specified.
Struggles with non-spherical clusters and outliers.

Alternatives to K-Means
Hierarchical Clustering:
Builds a hierarchy of clusters using a dendrogram.
Does not require predefining the number of clusters.
Useful for interpretability and informative outputs.
Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN):
Groups points based on density.
Automatically determines the number of clusters.
Effective for arbitrary-shaped clusters and outlier detection.

Applications
Customer segmentation.
Fraud detection and anomaly identification.
Data compression and visualization.

Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
Definition: A Gaussian Mixture Model assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of kkk Gaussian distributions, each characterized by its own mean and variance.

Key Features
Probabilistic Clustering:
Unlike k-means (a deterministic algorithm), GMMs assign probabilities to each data point belonging to a cluster.
Flexibility:
GMMs consider the mean and variance of each cluster, making them more adaptable to data with arbitrary cluster shapes or overlapping regions.
Dynamic kkk:
While kkk (the number of clusters) is still a parameter, GMMs can provide insights into the true value of kkk.

Applications
Detecting anomalies in user behavior.
Identifying clusters in low-dimensional or overlapping datasets.
Advanced use cases in ML research and engineering.

Advantages Over K-Means
Models non-spherical clusters.
Captures the distribution of data better using mean and variance.
Handles overlapping clusters more effectively.
Neural Networks Overview
Definition: Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neurons, designed to process inputs and learn patterns through layers of interconnected nodes.
Recent Popularity: With the rise of big data and affordable computing, neural networks, especially deep learning models, have become widely used in solving complex problems.

Key Concepts
Perceptron:
Single Layer Perceptron: The simplest form of a neural network, which takes weighted inputs, applies a linear combination, and passes the result through an activation function.
Function: Computes: y=f(∑iwixi+b)y = f(\sum_{i} w_i x_i + b)y=f(i∑​wi​xi​+b) Where fff is the activation function, wiw_iwi​ are weights, and bbb is the bias.
Activation Functions:
Add non-linearity to the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.
Common types:
Step Function: Binary output.
Sigmoid: Produces probabilities.
ReLU: Handles vanishing gradients and enables deep layers.
Tanh: Scales outputs between -1 and 1.
Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs):
Combine multiple perceptrons across layers to form a network capable of solving non-linear problems.
Consist of:
Input Layer: Receives raw data.
Hidden Layers: Extract features and learn representations.
Output Layer: Provides predictions.

Key Interview Topics
Gradient Descent:
Optimization algorithm for updating weights by minimizing the loss function.
Types: Batch, Stochastic, and Mini-batch Gradient Descent.
Backpropagation:
Algorithm to compute gradients for training deep networks.
Works by propagating errors backward through the network.
Deep Learning vs. Traditional Machine Learning:
Deep learning excels with large data and complex tasks (e.g., image or speech recognition).
Traditional models are more interpretable and work well with smaller datasets.

Applications
Computer Vision (e.g., facial recognition, object detection).
Natural Language Processing (e.g., language translation, chatbots).
Autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving cars).
Backpropagation Overview
Definition: Backpropagation is the process used in neural networks to update weights iteratively by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights.
Goal: Minimize the loss function by adjusting weights through optimization techniques like stochastic gradient descent.

How Backpropagation Works
Forward Pass:
The input data is passed through the network to compute the predicted output zzz.
Loss Calculation:
The difference between the predicted output and the actual target yyy is computed using a loss function (L(z,y)L(z, y)L(z,y)).
Backward Pass:
Gradients of the loss with respect to the weights (www) are calculated using the chain rule: ∂L(z,y)∂w=∂L(z,y)∂x⋅∂x∂z⋅∂z∂w\frac{\partial L(z, y)}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial L(z, y)}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial z} \cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial w}∂w∂L(z,y)​=∂x∂L(z,y)​⋅∂z∂x​⋅∂w∂z​
Weight Update:
Weights are updated using: w=w−α∂L(z,y)∂ww = w - \alpha \frac{\partial L(z, y)}{\partial w}w=w−α∂w∂L(z,y)​
α\alphaα is the learning rate, which controls the step size of updates.

Loss Functions
Regression:
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is commonly used.
Classification:
Cross-entropy loss is standard for multi-class problems.

Hyperparameters to Understand
Learning Rate (α\alphaα):
Too Small: Slow convergence.
Too Large: Overshooting or suboptimal convergence.
Other Hyperparameters:
Number of hidden layers.
Activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).
Batch size: Impacts computational efficiency and convergence stability.

Key Interview Points
Explain the process of backpropagation using gradient descent.
Common Questions:
How hyperparameters like learning rate or batch size affect training.
The mathematical foundation of weight updates.
Tip: Be prepared to whiteboard explanations of backpropagation for simple models like linear regression or logistic regression.
Key Challenges in Training Neural Networks
Vanishing Gradients:
Gradients become very small in deep networks, particularly when traditional activation functions like hyperbolic tangent are used, leading to minimal weight updates.
This happens because gradients are multiplied across layers using the chain rule, reducing them exponentially.
Exploding Gradients:
Gradients become excessively large, destabilizing the training process.

Solutions to Gradient Issues
Advanced Architectures:
Residual Networks (ResNets): Allow gradients to flow directly to earlier layers without excessive multiplication.
LSTMs: Handle long-term dependencies by addressing gradient issues.
Activation Functions:
Use functions like ReLU, which mitigate gradient vanishing by keeping gradients constant for positive values.

Optimization Techniques
Vanilla Gradient Descent Challenges:
Can get stuck in suboptimal solutions or saddle points.
Requires careful tuning of the learning rate to avoid slow convergence or instability.

Overview of CNNs
Definition: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of neural network primarily used in computer vision tasks.
Purpose: Capture spatial dependencies within images by analyzing pixel neighborhoods through filters.

Key Components of CNNs
Convolution Layers:
Extract features such as edges, gradients, and textures from the image.
Each filter highlights specific aspects (e.g., edge detection or color gradients).
Activation Function (ReLU):
Adds non-linearity to the network, enabling it to learn complex features.
Pooling Layers:
Perform dimensionality reduction to make feature maps invariant to position and rotation.
Types:
Max pooling: Takes the maximum value in a region.
Average pooling: Takes the average value in a region.
Fully Connected Layer:
Flattens the feature maps and passes them to fully connected neurons for classification.
Softmax Layer:
Outputs probabilities for different classes (e.g., car, truck, or bicycle).

Example Workflow
Input an image (e.g., a traffic light).
Apply convolution + activation to extract features.
Pool the feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
Flatten the pooled features into a vector.
Use fully connected layers and softmax for classification (e.g., classify the light as red, green, or yellow).

Applications
Object detection (e.g., self-driving cars).
Image classification (e.g., facial recognition, medical imaging).
Image segmentation (e.g., highlighting road lanes).
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Definition: RNNs are neural networks designed for sequential data. They use an internal memory (hidden state) to retain information about previous steps in a sequence.
How They Work:
Nodes form a directed graph over a temporal sequence.
The current output depends on both the input at the current step and the network's previous state.
Applications:
Audio and video processing.
Time series forecasting.
Natural Language Processing (e.g., text generation, language translation).
Key Feature:
RNNs handle arbitrary input and output lengths, making them ideal for sequential data.
Limitation:
Struggles with learning long-term dependencies due to issues like vanishing gradients.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)
Definition: LSTMs are an advanced type of RNN designed to overcome the limitations of vanilla RNNs, particularly their inability to learn long-term dependencies.
Key Components:
Cell State: Stores long-term information.
Input Gate: Decides how much new information to add to the cell.

Reinforcement Learning Overview
Definition: Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning focused on teaching an agent to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize a reward function.
How It Works:
The agent takes actions, transitions between states, and receives feedback (rewards or penalties).
The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

Key Components of RL
Reward Function:
Quantifies how good or bad an action is in a specific state.
Defines the overall goal of the RL problem.
Policy:
The strategy that the agent uses to decide on actions based on states.
Maps states to actions.
Model:
Represents the environment's behavior.
Predicts the next state and reward given a current state and action.
Value Function:
Estimates the long-term cumulative reward expected from a state.
Helps optimize decisions to achieve long-term benefits.

Applications
Gaming: AlphaGo, chess, StarCraft, and other complex games.
Robotics: Control systems and autonomous navigation.

Key Interview Points
RL is particularly relevant when actions must be optimized rather than just predictions.
It assumes that the "good" actions are not predefined, unlike supervised learning.
Common use cases in interviews include gaming and robotics scenarios.
Overview
Purpose: Interviewers test how well you can apply ML techniques to solve real-world problems, not just theoretical knowledge or algorithm implementation.
Focus: Understanding business goals, constraints, and how ML fits into solving specific problems.
Key Skills: Asking the right questions, designing data pipelines, choosing evaluation metrics, and considering deployment strategies.

Step 1: Clarify the Problem and Constraints
Understand the Business Context:
What problem is being solved? How does it impact the business and stakeholders?
Are there regulatory or ethical considerations (e.g., data privacy laws)?
Questions to Clarify the Problem:
What is the dependent variable (target) to be modeled? For example, in a churn prediction model, how do you define churn?
How has the problem been approached previously, and what baseline metrics exist?
Is ML necessary, or would a simpler heuristic-based approach suffice?
Define Constraints:
What are the technical and resource limitations (e.g., latency, throughput)?
How will the solution be deployed (e.g., on-device or cloud)?
What is the acceptable trade-off between model complexity and deployment cost?

Key Considerations
Business Impact:
How will the ML solution add value to the business?
Who are the end users, and how will they benefit from the solution?
Model Risks:
What happens if predictions are incorrect? For example, a spam email being misclassified is less risky than a mortgage application being misapproved.
Scope of the Solution:
Does ML solve the entire problem, or is it a component of a larger pipeline?

Best Practices
Frame the problem clearly to avoid misaligned goals and wasted effort.
Ask relevant, focused questions to ensure you stay on track during interviews.
Avoid overcomplicating solutions; simple approaches often work well.
Step 2: Establish Metrics
Purpose: Select simple, observable, and attributable metrics to evaluate the success of your ML solution.
Key Considerations:
Align metrics with business objectives. For example, if optimizing customer support ticket classification, aim to reduce time to resolution or improve accuracy.
Use a single primary metric (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) for easier evaluation but mention related metrics to show a comprehensive understanding.
Determine realistic success criteria. For example, aim for a practical improvement over the baseline rather than 100% accuracy.
Combine sub-metrics (e.g., false positives and false negatives) into a single metric like the Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC) to balance trade-offs.

Step 3: Understand Your Data Sources
Importance: ML models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Poor-quality data leads to poor predictions.
Key Considerations:
Clearly articulate the data you need for solving the business problem.
Think creatively about sourcing data:
Use crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk).
Collect user data during onboarding processes.
Purchase third-party datasets if ethical and feasible.
Scrape data from online sources, ensuring compliance with legal regulations.
Leverage unlabeled data by using labeling services.
Evaluate data freshness, relevance, and coverage. For example:
How often is the data updated?
Is it biased or incomplete?
Explore techniques like data augmentation or synthetic data generation for edge cases where collecting more data is challenging.
Step 4: Explore Your Data
Purpose
Exploring data is a critical step in the machine learning workflow to understand the dataset's structure, identify potential issues, and extract initial insights.

Key Steps in Data Exploration
Profile the Columns:
Identify useful columns and discard those with little or no variance.
Check for noisy columns with odd or missing values.
Examine summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, quantiles).
Visualize the Data:
Distributions:
Visualize statistical properties like skewness and kurtosis.
Use histograms for continuous features (e.g., age, weight) to understand their ranges and distribution.
Categorical Variables:
Plot categories to evaluate distributions and relationships.
Correlation Matrix:
Identify relationships between variables and their correlation with the target variable.

Why Visualization Matters
Quote by John Tukey:
“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.”
Visualizing data helps uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies that are not immediately apparent from raw statistics.
Step 5: Clean Your Data
Purpose
Data cleaning is a critical step before modeling to ensure data quality and reliability. The process involves addressing missing values, outliers, and erroneous or irrelevant data.

Key Steps in Data Cleaning
Handle Missing Values:
Imputation:
Replace missing values with column mean, median, or mode.
Use predictive models or data distributions for more sophisticated imputation.
Removal:
Drop rows or columns with too many missing values as a last resort.
Address Outliers:
Outliers can arise due to manual data entry errors, logging issues, or actual data characteristics.
Options:
Remove outliers outright.
Truncate extreme values.
Leave them as is if they carry meaningful business context.
Types:
Univariate Outliers: Outliers in a single feature (e.g., age).
Multivariate Outliers: Outliers considering multiple features (e.g., a 4-year-old who is 5 feet tall).

Why Cleaning is Essential
Cleaning data prevents "garbage in, garbage out" scenarios, where poor data quality undermines model performance.
Ensures the dataset aligns with the target schema and objectives.
Step 6: Feature Engineering
Purpose
Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into a suitable format for machine learning models, enhancing model performance, and enabling simpler models to achieve better results. The process includes both feature selection (choosing relevant features) and feature preprocessing (transforming data).

Techniques for Quantitative Data
Transformations:
Apply functions like log, capping, or flooring to normalize skewed data and conform it to standard statistical distributions.
Binning:
Also called discretization or bucketing, this process converts continuous variables into discrete bins, reducing noise in the data.
Dimensionality Reduction:
Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduce the feature set to uncorrelated variables, simplifying the dataset without losing essential information.
Scaling and Standardization:
Normalize data to a range of 0 to 1 using min-max scaling.
Standardize data to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 using z-scores. This is crucial for algorithms like K-means that depend on comparable variances.

Techniques for Categorical Data
One-Hot Encoding:
Converts categories into binary vectors (e.g., one category represented by 1, others by 0).
Hashing:
Converts data into a fixed-dimensional vector using hashing, which is useful for high-cardinality features (e.g., large ranges of values).

Text Data Preprocessing
Stemming:
Reduces words to their root forms by removing suffixes (e.g., "liked" → "like").
Lemmatization:
Similar to stemming but considers the context and meaning of the word (e.g., "caring" → "care").
Filtering:
Removes stop words (e.g., "the," "and") and punctuation that do not add value to the analysis.
Bag-of-Words:
Represents text as a collection of words with their frequency in the dataset.
N-grams:
Extends bag-of-words by considering sequences of N words together.
Word Embeddings:
Converts words into vectors where similar words are closer in the vector space (e.g., word2vec, GloVe).
Step 7: Model Selection
Purpose
Model selection involves choosing the most appropriate machine learning algorithm based on business constraints, evaluation metrics, and data properties.

Factors to Consider When Selecting a Model
Training & Prediction Speed:
Linear regression is much faster to train compared to complex models like neural networks.
Budget:
Neural networks and other deep learning models can be computationally expensive.
Volume & Dimensionality of Data:
Neural networks handle large, high-dimensional datasets better than models like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
Categorical vs. Numerical Features:
Linear regression requires numerical inputs (e.g., via one-hot encoding for categorical variables), whereas tree-based models like decision trees can process categorical variables directly.
Explainability:
Interpretable models like linear regression are often preferred in scenarios with regulatory requirements or when debugging is essential, as opposed to "black box" models like neural networks.

Cheat Sheet for Algorithm Selection

t-SNE for non-linear, high-dimensional visualization.
Step 8: Model Training & Evaluation
Purpose
This step focuses on training and evaluating machine learning models, ensuring their performance is optimal and robust enough for deployment.

Key Elements
Model Training:
Implement train-validation-test splits to evaluate model performance.
Use cross-validation to minimize overfitting and validate the model's generalizability.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Evaluating Model Performance:
Compare your model to other potential models to determine its suitability.
Assess model parameters and their impact on predictions.
Evaluate feature importance to understand which inputs significantly influence the outcomes.
Addressing Challenges:
Handle biased training data by selecting appropriate evaluation metrics.
Manage data imbalances by employing techniques like oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling.

Sampling Techniques:
Random Sampling:
Selects data randomly, with or without replacement.
Stratified Sampling:
Ensures each subgroup of the population is proportionally represented in the sample.

Avoiding Issues:
Use regularization to prevent overfitting.
Analyze learning curves to identify performance plateaus and avoid unnecessary computational expense.
Ensure a proper understanding of the sampling method used, as incorrect strategies can lead to unreliable results.

Addressing Unbalanced Classes in Machine Learning
Handling unbalanced datasets is a common challenge in machine learning. Here are key techniques:
Increase Data: Gather more data for the minority class if possible. While challenging, it’s a straightforward way to address imbalance.
Evaluate with Proper Metrics: Use metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 Score, or ROC-AUC, which are more informative for imbalanced classes than simple accuracy.
Resampling Methods:
Oversampling: Increase samples of the minority class (e.g., using bootstrapping).
Undersampling: Reduce samples from the majority class.
Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to generate synthetic examples for the minority class by interpolating between existing instances.
Adjust Models:
Use models that inherently handle imbalances, such as Logistic Regression.
Adjust the decision threshold (e.g., from 0.5 to a lower value) to better classify the minority class.
Custom Cost Functions: Create a penalty for misclassifying the minority class to prioritize its accurate prediction.
Ensemble Models: Run ensemble models with adjusted class ratios to combine the strengths of resampling and balanced modeling.
Example Solution: Using SMOTE
SMOTE creates synthetic examples by identifying nearest neighbors and generating new instances by interpolating the minority class features. This technique is widely used to improve model performance on imbalanced datasets without relying solely on random oversampling or undersampling.
Solution #7.2: Squared Error (MSE) vs. Absolute Error (MAE)
Key Differences:
Definition:
MSE (Mean Squared Error): Errors are squared before averaging, giving more weight to large errors.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Uses the absolute value of errors, providing equal weight to all deviations.
Sensitivity to Outliers:
MSE is sensitive to outliers as large errors are disproportionately amplified due to squaring.
MAE is robust to outliers, making it more suitable when outliers are present.
Computational Complexity:
MSE: Easier to compute gradients, commonly used in optimization problems like linear regression.
MAE: Requires linear programming techniques, making gradient computation more complex.
Use Cases:
Use MSE when:
Large errors need to be penalized more heavily.
Computational efficiency is important.
Maximizing the likelihood of Gaussian-distributed random variables.
Use MAE when:
Robustness to outliers is required.
Minimizing the likelihood of Laplace-distributed random variables.
Conditional medians are prioritized (MAE minimizes the median, whereas MSE minimizes the mean).
Elbow Method for an Interviewer's Perspective
Concept:
The Elbow Method is a technique used in k-means clustering to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). It is based on the trade-off between the number of clusters and the reduction in the within-cluster sum of squared distances (SSE).

Explanation for Interview Assessment:
Plotting Explained Variation vs. k:
The method involves plotting SSE on the y-axis against the number of clusters (k) on the x-axis.
As k increases, the SSE decreases because clusters become smaller, leading to less intra-cluster variance.
Identifying the "Elbow":
The "elbow" point is where the rate of reduction in SSE significantly slows down. Beyond this point, additional clusters don’t provide substantial improvement.
In the graph provided, the elbow is at k = 6, indicating this is an appropriate number of clusters.
Why It’s Useful:
It helps balance overfitting (too many clusters) and underfitting (too few clusters).
It provides a visual way to determine an effective k in the absence of labeled data.

Points to Evaluate in an Interview:
Candidate's Understanding:
Can they explain the relationship between SSE and cluster count?
Do they understand why the "elbow" represents diminishing returns?
Practical Insights:
Can they describe situations where the Elbow Method might fail (e.g., when the "elbow" isn’t clear)?
Do they know alternative methods, such as the Silhouette Method or business intuition, to support decisions?
Critical Thinking:
Do they relate the technique to real-world use cases (e.g., clustering customers for marketing or patient segmentation in healthcare)?
Can they recognize that clustering is inherently unsupervised, and domain expertise plays a critical role?

Key Question for the Candidate:
"How would you determine the optimal number of clusters if the elbow isn’t clearly visible in the graph?"
This probes their ability to adapt and consider alternative methods or practical intuition.
When dealing with outliers in data during an interview or in a practical scenario, the following approaches can be highlighted:
Add Regularization:
Use techniques like L1 or L2 regularization to reduce the impact of outliers by minimizing variance. This helps improve model stability.
Try Different Models:
Use models that are robust to outliers, such as tree-based models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting). These models handle outliers better compared to linear regression.
Winsorize Data:
Cap extreme values to reduce their influence. For example, replace the top 5% of values with the 95th percentile and the bottom 5% with the 5th percentile.
Transform Data:
Apply transformations such as log transformation for skewed distributions. This can help normalize data and reduce the effect of outliers.
Change the Error Metric:
Use robust error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Huber Loss instead of Mean Squared Error (MSE), as these are less sensitive to large errors caused by outliers.
Remove Outliers (As a Last Resort):
Only remove outliers if they are confirmed to be anomalies with no meaningful contribution to the model. This step should be considered cautiously since it involves losing information about data variability.
Key Takeaway for Interviewers:
The focus should be on systematically addressing outliers rather than immediately discarding them. Mentioning techniques like regularization or robust modeling shows depth in understanding. Always emphasize evaluating the root cause of outliers before taking any action, as this demonstrates thoughtful problem-solving.
#7.5: Handling Correlated Predictors in Regression (Interview Perspective)
When running a regression model, the presence of correlated predictor variables (multicollinearity) can lead to the following issues:
Unstable Coefficient Estimates:
The coefficients and their signs may vary dramatically based on the inclusion or exclusion of correlated predictors.
Confidence intervals may include zero, making it unclear whether the variable is significantly influencing the outcome.
Misleading P-Values:
Variables that are actually important may show high p-values and appear insignificant due to the shared effect being "split" between correlated predictors.
Approaches to Address Correlated Predictors:
Remove or Combine Predictors:
Understand the Correlation: Identify whether predictors (e.g., XXX and 2X2X2X) are redundant or whether there are latent variables driving the correlation.
Remove Predictors: Exclude extraneous predictors that contribute to multicollinearity.
Combine Predictors: Create interaction terms or composite variables (e.g., the product of correlated variables).
Center the Data:
Centering predictors (subtracting the mean) reduces multicollinearity and narrows confidence intervals, making estimates more reliable.
Increase Sample Size:
Collecting more data improves the stability of coefficient estimates and reduces the impact of multicollinearity.
Apply Regularization:
Use methods like Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression, which penalize large coefficients and handle multicollinearity effectively.
Key Steps to Handle Missing Data:
Clarify the Missing Data:
Begin by understanding the nature of the missing data through clarifying questions:
Is the amount of missing data consistent across features?
Are the missing values numerical or categorical?
How extensive is the missing data (number of features and transactions)?
Are there patterns in the missing data, such as specific transaction types with high amounts of missing data?
Classification of Missing Data:
Identify the category of missing data to guide the handling strategy:
MCAR (Missing Completely at Random): The probability of data being missing is unrelated to any specific observed or unobserved data.
MAR (Missing at Random): The probability of missing data is related to observed data but not the missing data itself.
NMAR (Not Missing at Random): The missing data depends on factors that aren't observed or measured.
Interview Takeaway:
Emphasize context-driven analysis for addressing missing data.
Highlight the importance of identifying patterns and types of missingness (MCAR, MAR, NMAR) to implement appropriate imputation or handling strategies.
Show a logical, data-driven approach to investigating and resolving the issue, which demonstrates analytical depth and domain understanding.
This framework shows an interviewer you can systematically tackle co
Steps to Handle Missing Data:
Step 2: Establish a Baseline
A good approach begins by evaluating whether missing data significantly impacts the model's performance or business goals:
Example: If missing data relates to user behavior, such as IP addresses, it might affect fraud detection performance.
In contrast, missing irrelevant features (e.g., user’s middle name) may not significantly impact the results.
Consider building a baseline model that doesn't address missing data. This helps establish if imputing missing data is necessary.

Step 3: Impute Missing Data
Techniques for Imputation:
For continuous features: Use mean or median values.
For categorical data: Use the most common category or nearest neighbors.
Limitations:
Imputation doesn’t account for correlations between missing and existing features.
Some data, like transaction-specific details, might not align neatly with imputed values.

Step 4: Check Performance with Imputed Data
After imputing data, validate the model's performance:
Use cross-validation to compare results between the original dataset and the one with imputed values.
If imputation adds valuable information, performance should improve. If not, consider dropping the missing data.

Step 5: Other Approaches for Missing Data
Think creatively about filling in gaps:
Use external datasets. For example, missing business information (e.g., address type) can sometimes be filled using third-party resources like business directories.
Consider feature engineering or integrating data from additional sources to supplement the missing information.

Key Takeaway (Interviewer Perspective):
This structured framework demonstrates:
Critical Thinking: Identifying when missing data impacts the model's objectives.
Technical Proficiency: Applying imputation and validation techniques effectively.
Creativity: Exploring external datasets and alternative data strategies
Solution #7.8: Improving Logistic Regression Performance
Normalizing Features:
Ensure feature scales are standardized to prevent certain weights from dominating the model.
Adding Additional Features:
For problems with high bias, incorporate more meaningful features to improve predictive power.
Addressing Outliers:
Detect and determine whether outliers should be removed or retained, depending on their impact.
Selecting Variables:
Identify variables that introduce noise and remove them to streamline the model.
Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning:
Use k-fold cross-validation and test different hyperparameters (e.g., adding regularization terms) to optimize the model.
Considering Alternative Models:
If classes are not linearly separable, explore models like SVMs, tree-based algorithms, or neural networks.

Solution #7.9: Effect of Doubling Data on Regression Coefficients
Objective: Analyze if doubling data affects the least squares estimate for linear regression coefficients.
Mathematics:
The least squares estimator formula: β=(XTX)−1XTy\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Tyβ=(XTX)−1XTy
When data is doubled (XXX becomes [X;X][X; X][X;X] and yyy becomes [y;y][y; y][y;y]): β=(2XTX)−1(2XTy)\beta = (2X^TX)^{-1}(2X^Ty)β=(2XTX)−1(2XTy)
Simplifying the expression: β=(XTX)−1XTy\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Tyβ=(XTX)−1XTy
Conclusion:
Doubling the data does not change the regression coefficients.

Interviewer Perspective:
For Solution #7.8, assess the candidate's understanding of improving model performance by addressing overfitting, underfitting, and feature scaling. For Solution #7.9, ensure they demonstrate mathematical rigor in proving that scaling data doesn't affect coefficients, showcasing their foundational understanding of linear regression.
Gradient Boosting vs. Random Forests
Both gradient boosting and random forests use ensembles of decision trees, but there are significant structural and functional differences between the two:
Learning Process:
Gradient Boosting: Builds trees sequentially, with each tree learning from the mistakes of the previous ones.
Random Forests: Builds trees independently in parallel.
Combination of Results:
Gradient Boosting: Combines the results of weak learners iteratively, improving model predictions at each step.
Random Forests: Combines tree predictions through averaging (for regression) or majority voting (for classification).
Overfitting and Complexity:
Gradient boosting is more prone to overfitting due to its iterative focus on minimizing errors.
Random forests are less prone to overfitting, offering better bias-variance tradeoffs.
Training Time:
Gradient boosting is slower because it trains trees sequentially.
Random forests are faster since trees are trained in parallel.
Use Cases:
Gradient boosting excels in unbalanced datasets (e.g., fraud detection).
Random forests are suitable for tasks with noisy data and multi-class object detection (e.g., computer vision).
In interviews, you can mention that gradient boosting is often chosen for tasks requiring high accuracy and optimization (e.g., fraud detection), while random forests are preferred for tasks involving robustness to noise and interpretability.
Steps to improve the performance and relevance of an ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) model, particularly in the context of a business like DoorDash. Here's a summary from an interviewer's perspective:
Step 1: Clarify "Good" ETA Means
The first step emphasizes defining what constitutes a "good enough" ETA prediction based on business requirements. For example:
Understanding how accurate the ETA needs to be for customer satisfaction.
Identifying acceptable levels of under-prediction or over-prediction and their business impact.
Incorporating context into the analysis (e.g., how DoorDash ETA accuracy might differ between busy cities or rural areas).
Step 2: Assess Baseline ETA Performance
The baseline model's performance must be assessed, considering the average preparation and delivery times. Metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), or R2R^2R2 are recommended for regression tasks. This step ensures that performance improvement efforts are measurable.
Step 3: Determine How More Data Improves Accuracy
Using learning curves to understand how additional training data impacts performance.
Metrics such as R2R^2R2 can show how performance scales with increased data, providing insight into whether more data is likely to yield meaningful improvements.
Step 4: In Case Performance Isn’t "Good Enough"
If data limitations affect the model, explore ways to mitigate this, such as:
Adding meaningful features (e.g., traffic patterns, road conditions).
Reducing dimensionality to prevent overfitting.
Using alternative models better suited for small datasets.
Investigating cost-effective ways to acquire more data.
Proactive Discussion Points
Bring up practical questions about the dataset, feature engineering, or dimensionality reduction techniques.
Propose potential solutions like retraining or deploying in similar markets with improved data collection mechanisms.
From an interviewer's viewpoint, these steps reflect a candidate's ability to:
Understand and align models with business needs.
Address practical limitations (like data constraints) creatively.
Suggest actionable, cost-effective improvements in machine learning workflows.
This approach not only solves the problem at hand but also showcases structured thinking and proactive problem-solving—skills essential for ML-heavy roles.

partial dependence plots (PDPs) are utilized to evaluate the marginal effect of a feature on a machine learning model's predicted target. This visualization is particularly useful for understanding the influence of individual features on the outcome, while keeping other features constant.
Key Takeaways:
Purpose of PDPs: They help assess how one feature affects the model’s decision (e.g., loan approval/rejection). For instance:
A higher FICO score may correspond to a higher probability of loan approval.
Increased debt may reduce the probability of loan approval.
A higher number of credit cards might negatively affect loan approval likelihood.
Concrete Example:
Four hypothetical applicants are evaluated based on income, debt, number of credit cards, and FICO score.
If applicants with lower FICO scores are rejected while others with similar attributes (income, debt, credit cards) are accepted, it highlights the significance of the FICO score in the model’s decision-making.
Use Case:
By observing these plots, we can identify key drivers of the model’s predictions and provide insights into how to adjust feature values or weights to achieve desired outcomes.
In interviews, discussing PDPs demonstrates your ability to explain model interpretability and diagnose feature importance effectively, which is critical for domains like credit risk modeling or fairness in decision-making systems.

Iterative Approach: Clarify requirements, analyze data, experiment with models, and evaluate outcomes systematically.
Justify Choices: Be ready to explain why specific metrics, models, or preprocessing steps were chosen.
Communicate Clearly: Use simple, structured language to demonstrate your thought process.
Solution #7.20: L1 and L2 Regularization
L1 Regularization: Adds the absolute value of coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function. It encourages sparsity by driving some weights to zero, making it useful for feature selection.
L2 Regularization: Adds the squared magnitude of coefficients as a penalty. It helps reduce overfitting by penalizing large coefficients but does not inherently promote sparsity.
Key Insight: L1 is more suitable for feature selection, while L2 is better for regularization without reducing the number of features significantly.

Solution #7.21: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Purpose: Optimizes a loss function by taking iterative steps proportional to the negative gradient of the function at a random sample.
Advantages:
Faster convergence for large datasets.
Reduces computational complexity by updating weights based on a single data point rather than the full dataset.
Key Insight: While SGD is computationally efficient, it may lead to instability or slow convergence due to noisy gradient estimates.

Solution #7.22: ROC Curve
ROC Curve Dynamics:
The curve remains unchanged if the scores are scaled in a monotonic fashion (e.g., taking the square root of the scores).
Non-monotonic transformations can disrupt the order of scores, altering the ROC curve.
Key Insight: Monotonicity is critical in preserving the relative ranking of scores when evaluating models using the ROC curve.

General Takeaway:
Regularization techniques like L1 and L2 address overfitting differently, making them suitable for distinct scenarios.
SGD is efficient for large datasets but requires careful tuning of the learning rate.
When interpreting ROC curves, maintaining the relative order of scores is crucial to ensure consistent evaluation metrics.
Solution #7.20 - L1 and L2 Regularization
L1 Regularization: Adds an absolute penalty to the loss function, promoting sparsity by driving weights to zero. Often used in Lasso regression for feature selection.
L2 Regularization: Adds a squared penalty to the loss function, reducing overfitting by discouraging large weights, commonly used in Ridge regression.
Comparison: L1 creates sparse models by zeroing coefficients, whereas L2 shrinks weights more uniformly.
Solution #7.21 - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Key Concept: SGD updates weights incrementally by randomly sampling a single data point at each iteration. It’s faster for large datasets but noisier than batch gradient descent.
Advantages: Efficient for massive datasets, avoids memory issues, and adds variability to escape local minima.
Formulation: Derives unbiased gradients for optimization by averaging over individual data points.
Solution #7.22 - ROC Curve Invariance
Changing scores linearly (e.g., applying a square root) doesn't impact the ROC curve, as relative ordering remains unchanged.
ROC curve integrity depends on monotonic transformations of scores.
Non-monotonic changes (e.g., reversing sign) disrupt relative ordering and hence affect the curve.
Solution #7.23 - Entropy of Gaussian Random Variable
Derived entropy for Gaussian distributions quantifies uncertainty in continuous random variables.
Formula: H(X)=12log⁡σ2+log⁡2πH(X) = \frac{1}{2} \log \sigma^2 + \log \sqrt{2\pi}H(X)=21​logσ2+log2π​, where σ2\sigma^2σ2 represents variance.
Solution #7.24 - Propensity Models
Logistic regression provides a baseline approach for modeling propensity to buy products, offering interpretable coefficients but limited flexibility for complex interactions.
Alternatives like tree-based models (e.g., random forests) offer better feature interpretability and handle non-linear interactions effectively.
Neural networks and SVMs are robust for high-dimensional data but require extensive datasets and are less interpretable.
Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Logistic Regression, highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and differences, while offering insights on when to prefer one over the other:

Advantages:
GNB:
Requires a small number of observations for training.
Fast and simple to implement.
Easy interpretation of results.
Logistic Regression:
Provides a clear and interpretable model.
Facilitates inference about feature importance and their effects on predictions.

Disadvantages:
GNB:
Assumes feature independence, which is often violated in real-world scenarios.
Logistic Regression:
Struggles with complex feature interactions.
Can overfit when training data is insufficient.

Key Differences:
Logistic regression is a discriminative classifier (models P(Y∣X)P(Y|X)P(Y∣X)), while GNB is generative (models P(X∣Y)P(X|Y)P(X∣Y) and P(Y)P(Y)P(Y)).
Logistic regression requires an optimization step for coefficients, while GNB does not.

Similarities:
Both are linear decision functions based on training data.
The implied P(Y∣X)P(Y|X)P(Y∣X) of GNB matches that of logistic regression (with additional assumptions).

When to Use:
Logistic Regression:
Preferred when training data is sufficient, and independence assumptions of GNB are invalid.
Ideal for capturing correlations between features.
GNB:
Suitable when training data is limited or when strong priors on data generation are available.
Faster to implement when feature independence is a reasonable assumption.
Solution #7.12: Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
Key Insight: Partial Dependence Plots illustrate the marginal effect of features on model predictions by isolating the influence of each feature while keeping others constant.
Example Application:
Features like FICO score, debt, and the number of credit cards are examined individually.
The FICO score shows a positive correlation with loan approval.
Low scores lead to rejection, while higher scores improve the likelihood of approval.
Takeaway: PDPs are particularly useful for explaining model decisions, identifying influential features, and understanding the reasoning behind specific outcomes (e.g., why applicants with FICO scores of 700 and 720 were approved, but 600 was rejected).
Solution #7.13: Finding Synonyms Using Word Embeddings
Key Insight: Word embeddings map words into vector space based on context and semantic similarity, enabling tasks like finding synonyms through distance measures like Euclidean distance.
Process:
Generate word embeddings for a given corpus.
Apply clustering techniques like K-means or K-nearest neighbors to group similar words.
Challenges: Antonyms and semantically similar but opposite words (e.g., "hot" and "cold") can be clustered together due to similar contexts.
Use Case: Useful for NLP tasks, such as creating synonym dictionaries, search engines, or recommendation systems. However, care must be taken in edge cases where semantic opposites may cluster.
7.14: Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Key Insights:
Bias-Variance Tradeoff:
Total model error is broken down as Bias + Variance + Irreducible Error.
High bias occurs when a model is too simple (e.g., linear regression for a nonlinear relationship) and underfits the data.
High variance occurs when a model overfits, capturing noise and reacting to small changes in the data.
Irreducible error is inherent in data and cannot be addressed by the model.
Objective:
Balance bias and variance to achieve good performance without overfitting or underfitting.
Example: Linear regression has low variance but high bias; neural networks might have low bias but high variance.

Solution #7.15: Cross-Validation
Key Insights:
Purpose:
Evaluates model performance by splitting the training data into multiple subsets (folds).
Ensures robust performance across different data samples and prevents overfitting.
Process:
Split data into k equally sized folds.
Train on all folds except one, and test on the excluded fold.
Repeat for each fold and average the errors for true error estimation.
Advantages:
Avoids training and testing on the same data.
Maximizes the use of available data for training and testing.
Drawbacks:
Computationally intensive for large datasets, as it requires multiple training cycles.
Cross-validation is especially effective for smaller datasets where a separate validation set may not be feasible. It ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
#7.16: Lead Scoring Model Design
Clarifying Lead Scoring Requirements:
Determine whether the solution is for internal use (e.g., Salesforce’s own lead scoring) or for external clients (e.g., an extensible product).
Understand the scope (specific CRM database or a broader dataset) and any unique business requirements.
Feature Selection:
Important features influencing lead conversion include:
Firmographic Data: Industry type, revenue, employee count.
Marketing Activity: Interaction with marketing materials, ad clicks, whitepaper downloads.
Sales Activity: Sales meetings, recent interactions, deal size.
Deal Details: Complexity of deals, contract lengths, and product types.
Model Selection:
Use logistic regression for straightforward interpretation but avoid it for small, correlated datasets.
Neural networks or SVMs can handle complex relationships, but they require more data and computational effort.
Tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) are good compromises, offering robust predictions and interpretable feature importance.
Model Deployment Nuances:
Monitor feature drift and data relevance over time, especially in dynamic customer databases.
Regularly update models to ensure alignment with current business trends and datasets.

Solution #7.17: Collaborative Filtering for Music Recommendation
Key Insights:
Collaborative filtering leverages user feedback to make personalized recommendations.
Differences from movie recommendations include the absence of a 1-5 rating scale, repeated consumption patterns, and the larger catalog of songs.
Matrix factorization is used to capture user preferences and make predictions using methods like alternating least squares (ALS) or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Solution #7.18: Convexity and Non-Convex Neural Networks
Key Insights:
Convex functions have no local minima that are not global minima.
Neural networks are non-convex due to their architecture, which allows multiple configurations producing the same output, creating local minima and complexity in optimization.
Solution #7.19: Information Gain and Entropy
Key Insights:
Entropy measures the homogeneity of data; low entropy indicates purer subsets.
Information gain quantifies the reduction in entropy after splitting data on an attribute, crucial for decision tree construction.
Applications and Practical Relevance:
These concepts are foundational for building systems like recommendation engines, neural network models, and decision trees, highlighting their role in real-world applications.
The explanations underscore the need for tailored approaches (e.g., collaborative filtering for large-scale datasets) and theoretical understanding (e.g., convexity and entropy).
Solution #7.19: Information Gain and Entropy
Entropy quantifies the level of impurity or disorder in a dataset. It is calculated using the formula: Entropy=−∑kP(Y=k)log⁡P(Y=k)\text{Entropy} = - \sum_{k} P(Y = k) \log P(Y = k)Entropy=−k∑​P(Y=k)logP(Y=k)
Homogeneous data results in an entropy of 0, while a perfectly split dataset (50%-50%) results in entropy of 1.
Information Gain (IG) measures the reduction in entropy after a dataset is split on an attribute:
IG(X,Y)=H(Y)−H(Y∣X)IG(X, Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)IG(X,Y)=H(Y)−H(Y∣X)
Example: After splitting data on an attribute, the decrease in entropy results in an IG score, which is used to decide the most useful attributes for classification.
Solution #7.20: Regularization with L1 and L2
Regularization prevents overfitting by penalizing large coefficients in regression models:
L1 Regularization (Lasso):
Adds the absolute value of coefficients as a penalty term.
Results in sparse models by forcing some coefficients to become exactly zero.
L2 Regularization (Ridge):
Adds the squared magnitude of coefficients as a penalty term.
Shrinks coefficients but rarely reduces them to zero.
Formula for loss functions: Loss(L1)=L+λ∣wi∣,Loss(L2)=L+λwi2\text{Loss(L1)} = L + \lambda |w_i|, \quad \text{Loss(L2)} = L + \lambda w_i^2Loss(L1)=L+λ∣wi​∣,Loss(L2)=L+λwi2​
Key difference: L1 induces sparsity, while L2 minimizes large variations without sparsity.
Practical Applications:
Use entropy and IG in decision tree models to determine the best split points.
Apply regularization techniques to balance model complexity and generalizability, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data or correlated predictors.
Solution #7.21: Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Gradient Descent:
It is an optimization algorithm that takes small steps in the direction of steepest descent of the objective function to minimize it.
The size of each step is proportional to the gradient at the current parameter value.
While effective, this method is computationally expensive when applied to large datasets because it evaluates the gradient over the entire dataset at each step.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):
This variation of gradient descent estimates the gradient using only one randomly selected data point or a small batch instead of the full dataset.
Advantages:
Faster and computationally cheaper for large datasets.
Can escape saddle points and local minima due to its randomness.
Drawback:
Introduces noise into the optimization process, potentially leading to oscillations around the minima.
The algorithm is unbiased since the expectation of the stochastic gradient matches the true gradient.

Solution #7.22: ROC Curve and Monotonicity of Scores
ROC Curve Basics:
Plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) across different classification thresholds.
Reflects the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity of a model.
Effect of Transforming Scores:
Monotonic Transformations (e.g., f(x)=x2f(x) = x^2f(x)=x2):
Do not alter the ordering of scores.
The ROC curve remains unchanged since relative rankings of predictions stay the same.
Non-Monotonic Transformations (e.g., f(x)=−xf(x) = -xf(x)=−x):
Disrupt score rankings and invalidate the ROC curve because the order of true and false positives is altered.
Takeaways:
Monotonic transformations preserve the ROC curve, while non-monotonic transformations break it.
This highlights the importance of preserving score rankings in applications like binary classification.
Solution #7.23 - Entropy for a Continuous Random Variable
Entropy for a continuous random variable measures the uncertainty in the variable's probability distribution. For a Gaussian distribution, entropy H(x)H(x)H(x) can be derived as:
H(x)=−∫p(x)log⁡p(x)dxH(x) = -\int p(x) \log p(x) dxH(x)=−∫p(x)logp(x)dx
Using the Gaussian probability density function p(x)p(x)p(x), the derivation leads to:
H(x)=12log⁡(2πeσ2)H(x) = \frac{1}{2} \log (2 \pi e \sigma^2)H(x)=21​log(2πeσ2)
This result demonstrates that the entropy depends only on the variance σ2\sigma^2σ2 of the Gaussian distribution, providing a measure of uncertainty or spread.

Solution #7.24 - Building a Model for Propensity Prediction

Tree-Based Models (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost):
Offer high accuracy and better interpretability compared to complex models.
Key advantage: Can highlight the influence of individual features, aiding in actionable insights.
Key Insight:
The choice of model depends on the complexity of the data and business requirements. Tree-based models provide a good balance between interpretability and performance, making them suitable for predicting customer propensity.

Advantages:
GNB: Efficient with small datasets, quick to train, and interpretable.
Logistic Regression: Interpretable in terms of feature significance and probability outputs.
Disadvantages:
GNB: Assumes independence of features, which may not hold true in real-world data.
Logistic Regression: May fail to model complex feature interactions or require more data to avoid overfitting.
Differences:
GNB is a generative model that models the joint distribution P(Y,X)P(Y, X)P(Y,X), whereas Logistic Regression is a discriminative model that directly estimates P(Y∣X)P(Y|X)P(Y∣X).
Use Case:
GNB is preferable for small datasets or when strong priors exist, while Logistic Regression excels when assumptions of independence do not hold or when data size is sufficient.

Solution #7.26: Loss Function in K-Means Clustering
Key Points:
Loss Function: The objective is to minimize the squared L2L_2L2​-norm (sum of squared distances) within clusters.
Batch Gradient Descent:
Updates cluster centroids by averaging the distances between data points and their assigned cluster.
Stochastic Gradient Descent:
Adds randomness by updating centroids based on individual points rather than the entire cluster.
Insights:
Stochastic updates may be faster for large datasets but can introduce noise, potentially slowing convergence.
Batch updates are computationally heavier but yield stable solutions.

Overall Insights:
Gaussian Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression:
GNB is lightweight and interpretable but can falter when independence assumptions fail.
Logistic Regression is better for capturing feature relationships but requires more data and computational resources.
K-Means Optimization:
Gradient descent (batch vs stochastic) methods provide flexibility in solving clustering problems.
For large-scale problems, stochastic gradient descent is often preferred due to faster updates.
Choosing Models:
Decision-making depends on:
Data Size: Smaller datasets favor simpler models (e.g., GNB).
Feature Independence: When independence assumptions are invalid, discriminative models are better.

Key Insight: This method efficiently calculates the parameters that maximize the probability of observing the data.

Solution #7.29: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
Objective: Use GMM to model data using KKK Gaussian distributions for clustering.
Formulae and Explanation:

Solution #7.29 extends Gaussian concepts into clustering, with applications in anomaly detection and classification.
Solution #7.30: Understanding and Modeling Churn
Step 1: Clarify What Churn Is and Why It’s Important
Definition: Churn represents the loss of users over time on a platform.
Robinhood Example:
Churned users may stop trading or maintaining account balances.
Loss of revenue for Robinhood could come from inactive users no longer utilizing Robinhood Gold memberships or having negligible account activity.
Impact:
Even small monthly churn rates can compound into significant yearly losses.
Acquiring new users is costlier than retaining current ones, so high churn rates can pressure businesses to allocate more resources for acquisition.
Step 2: Modeling Considerations
Purpose of Modeling:
Identify customers likely to churn.
Aid in designing targeted retention strategies or campaigns.
Key Factors for Model Selection:
Explainability:
If stakeholders need to understand the factors driving churn, interpretable models like decision trees, random forests, or logistic regression should be used.
Models that provide probabilities (e.g., logistic regression) are preferred when the focus is on predicting likelihood rather than simple classification.
Complexity vs. Interpretability:
If explainability isn’t critical (e.g., it’s sufficient to detect churn), more complex models like neural networks or SVMs can be considered.
Insights
Business Implications: A well-defined churn analysis aligns business goals with actionable insights, ensuring resource allocation supports meaningful retention strategies.
Model Selection: The balance between interpretability and predictive performance depends on the use case and stakeholder needs.
Proactivity: Addressing churn involves understanding its causes, predicting likely churners, and mitigating through tailored interventions.
Solution #7.30 Summary: Churn Modeling for Robinhood
Defining Churn:
Churn refers to the loss of users over time.
It's critical to clarify the definition with stakeholders (e.g., inactive accounts, account closures).
Churn impacts profitability due to the high cost of acquiring new users versus retaining existing ones.
Modeling Considerations:
Use classification algorithms to predict if a user will churn.
Prioritize interpretable models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) for actionable insights unless stakeholders are fine with complex models (e.g., neural networks, SVMs).
Features to Use for Modeling:
Raw account balance: e.g., if balance falls below $10.
Account balance trends: consistent withdrawals might indicate dissatisfaction.
Experienced heavy losses: could lead to behavioral shifts.
Recent usage patterns: reduced activity signals disengagement.
Demographics: age, gender, and location might provide contextual clues.
Deployment:
Before deploying, validate the model’s effectiveness using metrics like the ROC curve and F1 score.
Regularly monitor model performance in production to adjust for data or business changes.
Conduct A/B testing to validate improvements.

Solution #7.31 Summary: Multivariate Gaussian Likelihood
Formulation:
Assumes Y∼N(Xβ,σ2I)Y \sim N(X\beta, \sigma^2 I)Y∼N(Xβ,σ2I), where β\betaβ is the coefficient vector and σ2I\sigma^2 Iσ2I is the variance.
Optimization Objective:
Log-likelihood simplifies to minimizing the sum of squared residuals: argminβ(Xβ−Y)T(Xβ−Y)\text{argmin}_\beta (X\beta - Y)^T (X\beta - Y)argminβ​(Xβ−Y)T(Xβ−Y).
Insight:
This is equivalent to solving a least-squares regression problem, making it computationally straightforward.

Step 3: Collaborative Filtering Model Setup
Uses a user-song matrix to recommend songs based on feedback (e.g., play counts as a proxy for preference).
Explains collaborative filtering, focusing on matrix operations like dot products and relevance scoring.
Methods like k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) can measure similarity across users or songs.
Step 4: Additional Considerations
Pros and Cons: Collaborative filtering scales well but struggles with "cold start" issues for new users or songs.
Challenges: Handling large-scale datasets and fast-changing music trends require regular model retraining.
Evaluation: Use A/B testing and track user engagement (e.g., time spent listening) to measure impact.

Machine Learning Core Interview Question
Q1. What are the different types of Machine Learning?

There are three ways in which machines learn:
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Reinforcement Learning
Supervised Learning:
Supervised learning is a method in which the machine learns using labeled data.
It is like learning under the guidance of a teacher
The training dataset is like a teacher which is used to train the machine
Model is trained on a pre-defined dataset before it starts making decisions when given new data
Unsupervised Learning:
Unsupervised learning is a method in which the machine is trained on unlabelled data or without any guidance
It is like learning without a teacher.
The model learns through observation & finds structures in data.
Model is given a dataset and is left to automatically find patterns and relationships in that dataset by creating clusters.
Reinforcement Learning:
Reinforcement learning involves an agent that interacts with its environment by producing actions & discovers errors or rewards.
It is like being stuck in an isolated island, where you must explore the environment and learn how to live and adapt to the living conditions on your own.
Model learns through the hit and trial method
It learns on the basis of reward or penalty given for every action it performs
Q2. How would you explain Machine Learning to a school-going kid?
Suppose your friend invites you to his party where you meet total strangers. Since you have no idea about them, you will mentally classify them on the basis of gender, age group, dressing, etc.
In this scenario, the strangers represent unlabeled data and the process of classifying unlabeled data points is nothing but unsupervised learning.
Since you didn’t use any prior knowledge about people and classified them on-the-go, this becomes an unsupervised learning problem.
Q3. How does Deep Learning differ from Machine Learning?

Q4. Explain Classification and Regression

Q5. What do you understand about selectionby selection bias?
It is a statistical error that causes a bias in the sampling portion of an experiment.
The error causes one sampling group to be selected more often than other groups included in the experiment.
Selection bias may produce an inaccurate conclusion if the selection bias is not identified
Q6. What do you understand by Precision and Recall?
Let me explain you this with an analogy:
Imagine that, your girlfriend gave you a birthday surprise every year for the last 10 years. One day, your girlfriend asks you: ‘Sweetie, do you remember all the birthday surprises from me?’
To stay on good terms with your girlfriend, you need to recall all the 10 events from your memory. Therefore, recall is the ratio of the number of events you can correctly recall, to the total number of events.
If you can recall all 10 events correctly, then, your recall ratio is 1.0 (100%) and if you can recall 7 events correctly, your recall ratio is 0.7 (70%)
However, you might be wrong in some answers.
For example, let’s assume that you took 15 guesses out of which 10 were correct and 5 were wrong. This means that you can recall all events but not so precisely
Therefore, precision is the ratio of a number of events you can correctly recall, to the total number of events you can recall (mix of correct and wrong recalls).
From the above example (10 real events, 15 answers: 10 correct, 5 wrong), you get 100% recall but your precision is only 66.67% (10 / 15)
Q7. Explain false negative, false positive, true negative and true positive with a simple example.
Let’s consider a scenario of a fire emergency:
True Positive: If the alarm goes on in case of a fire.
Fire is positive and prediction made by the system is true.
False Positive: If the alarm goes on, and there is no fire.
System predicted fire to be positive which is a wrong prediction, hence the prediction is false.
False Negative: If the alarm does not ring but there was a fire.
System predicted fire to be negative which was false since there was fire.
True Negative: If the alarm does not ring and there was no fire.
The fire is negative and this prediction was true.
Q8. What is the Confusion Matrix?
A confusion matrix or an error matrix is a table which is used for summarizing the performance of a classification algorithm.

Consider the above table where:
TN = True Negative
TP = True Positive
FN = False Negative
FP = False Positive
Q9. What is the difference between inductive and deductive learning?
Inductive learning is the process of using observations to draw conclusions
Deductive learning is the process of using conclusions to form observations

Q10. How is KNN different from K-means clustering?

Q11. What is ROC curve and what does it represent?
Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (or ROC curve) is a fundamental tool for diagnostic test evaluation and is a plot of the true positive rate (Sensitivity) against the false positive rate (Specificity) for the different possible cut-off points of a diagnostic test.

It shows the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity (any increase in sensitivity will be accompanied by a decrease in specificity).
The closer the curve follows the left-hand border and then the top border of the ROC space, the more accurate the test.
The closer the curve comes to the 45-degree diagonal of the ROC space, the less accurate the test.
The slope of the tangent line at a cutpoint gives the likelihood ratio (LR) for that value of the test.
The area under the curve is a measure of test accuracy.
Q12. What’s the difference between Type I and Type II error?

Q13. Is it better to have too many false positives or too many false negatives? Explain.

It depends on the question as well as on the domain for which we are trying to solve the problem. If you’re using Machine Learning in the domain of medical testing, then a false negative is very risky, since the report will not show any health problem when a person is actually unwell. Similarly, if Machine Learning is used in spam detection, then a false positive is very risky because the algorithm may classify an important email as spam.
Q14. Which is more important to you — model accuracy or model performance?

Well, you must know that model accuracy is only a subset of model performance. The accuracy of the model and performance of the model are directly proportional and hence better the performance of the model, more accurate are the predictions.
Q15. What is the difference between Gini Impurity and Entropy in a Decision Tree?
Gini Impurity and Entropy are the metrics used for deciding how to split a Decision Tree.
Gini measurement is the probability of a random sample being classified correctly if you randomly pick a label according to the distribution in the branch.
Entropy is a measurement to calculate the lack of information. You calculate the Information Gain (difference in entropies) by making a split. This measure helps to reduce the uncertainty about the output label.
Q16. What is the difference between Entropy and Information Gain?
Entropy is an indicator of how messy your data is. It decreases as you reach closer to the leaf node.
The Information Gain is based on the decrease in entropy after a dataset is split on an attribute. It keeps on increasing as you reach closer to the leaf node.
Q17. What is Overfitting? And how do you ensure you’re not overfitting with a model?
Over-fitting occurs when a model studies the training data to such an extent that it negatively influences the performance of the model on new data.
This means that the disturbance in the training data is recorded and learned as concepts by the model. But the problem here is that these concepts do not apply to the testing data and negatively impact the model’s ability to classify the new data, hence reducing the accuracy on the testing data.
Three main methods to avoid overfitting:
Collect more data so that the model can be trained with varied samples.
Use ensembling methods, such as Random Forest. It is based on the idea of bagging, which is used to reduce the variation in the predictions by combining the result of multiple Decision trees on different samples of the data set.
Choose the right algorithm.
Q18.Explain Ensemble learning technique in Machine Learning.

Ensemble learning is a technique that is used to create multiple Machine Learning models, which are then combined to produce more accurate results. A general Machine Learning model is built by using the entire training data set. However, in Ensemble Learning the training data set is split into multiple subsets, wherein each subset is used to build a separate model. After the models are trained, they are then combined to predict an outcome in such a way that the variance in the output is reduced.
Q19. What is bagging and boosting in Machine Learning?

Q20. How would you screen for outliers and what should you do if you find one?
The following methods can be used to screen outliers:
Boxplot: A box plot represents the distribution of the data and its variability. The box plot contains the upper and lower quartiles, so the box basically spans the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR). One of the main reasons why box plots are used is to detect outliers in the data. Since the box plot spans the IQR, it detects the data points that lie outside this range. These data points are nothing but outliers.
Probabilistic and statistical models: Statistical models such as normal distribution and exponential distribution can be used to detect any variations in the distribution of data points. If any data point is found outside the distribution range, it is rendered as an outlier.
Linear models: Linear models such as logistic regression can be trained to flag outliers. In this manner, the model picks up the next outlier it sees.
Proximity-based models: An example of this kind of model is the K-means clustering model wherein, data points form multiple or ‘k’ number of clusters based on features such as similarity or distance. Since similar data points form clusters, the outliers also form their own cluster. In this way, proximity-based models can easily help detect outliers.
How do you handle these outliers?
If your data set is huge and rich then you can risk dropping the outliers.
However, if your data set is small then you can cap the outliers, by setting a threshold percentile. For example, the data points that are above the 95th percentile can be used to cap the outliers.
Lastly, based on the data exploration stage, you can narrow down some rules and impute the outliers based on those business rules.
Q21. What are collinearity and multicollinearity?
Collinearity occurs when two predictor variables (e.g., x1 and x2) in a multiple regression have some correlation.
Multicollinearity occurs when more than two predictor variables (e.g., x1, x2, and x3) are inter-correlated.
Q22. What do you understand by Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues?
Eigenvectors: Eigenvectors are those vectors whose direction remains unchanged even when a linear transformation is performed on them.
Eigenvalues: Eigenvalue is the scalar that is used for the transformation of an Eigenvector.

In the above example, 3 is an Eigenvalue, with the original vector in the multiplication problem being an eigenvector.
The Eigenvector of a square matrix A is a nonzero vector x such that for some number λ, we have the following:
Ax = λx,
where λ is an Eigenvalue
So, in our example, λ = 3 and X = [1 1 2]
Q23. What is A/B Testing?
A/B is Statistical hypothesis testing for a randomized experiment with two variables A and B. It is used to compare two models that use different predictor variables in order to check which variable fits best for a given sample of data.
Consider a scenario where you’ve created two models (using different predictor variables) that can be used to recommend products for an e-commerce platform.
A/B Testing can be used to compare these two models to check which one best recommends products to a customer.

Q24. What is Cluster Sampling?
It is a process of randomly selecting intact groups within a defined population, sharing similar characteristics.
Cluster Sample is a probability sample where each sampling unit is a collection or cluster of elements.
For example, if you’re clustering the total number of managers in a set of companies, in that case, managers (samples) will represent elements and companies will represent clusters.
Q25. Running a binary classification tree algorithm is quite easy. But do you know how the tree decides on which variable to split at the root node and its succeeding child nodes?
Measures such as, Gini Index and Entropy can be used to decide which variable is best fitted for splitting the Decision Tree at the root node.
We can calculate Gini as following:
Calculate Gini for sub-nodes, using the formula — sum of square of probability for success and failure (p²+q²).
Calculate Gini for split using weighted Gini score of each node of that split
Entropy is the measure of impurity or randomness in the data, (for binary class):

Here p and q is the probability of success and failure respectively in that node.
Entropy is zero when a node is homogeneous and is maximum when both the classes are present in a node at 50% — 50%. To sum it up, the entropy must be as low as possible in order to decide whether or not a variable is suitable as the root node.
Machine Learning With Python Questions
This set of Machine Learning interview questions deal with Python-related Machine Learning questions.
Q1. Name a few libraries in Python used for Data Analysis and Scientific Computations.
Here is a list of Python libraries mainly used for Data Analysis:
NumPy
SciPy
Pandas
SciKit
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Bokeh
Q2. Which library would you prefer for plotting in Python language: Seaborn or Matplotlib or Bokeh?
It depends on the visualization you’re trying to achieve. Each of these libraries is used for a specific purpose:
Matplotlib: Used for basic plotting like bars, pies, lines, scatter plots, etc
Seaborn: Is built on top of Matplotlib and Pandas to ease data plotting. It is used for statistical visualizations like creating heatmaps or showing the distribution of your data
Bokeh: Used for interactive visualization. In case your data is too complex and you haven’t found any “message” in the data, then use Bokeh to create interactive visualizations that will allow your viewers to explore the data themselves
Q3. How are NumPy and SciPy related?
NumPy is part of SciPy.
NumPy defines arrays along with some basic numerical functions like indexing, sorting, reshaping, etc.
SciPy implements computations such as numerical integration, optimization and machine learning using NumPy’s functionality.
Q4. What is the main difference between a Pandas series and a single-column DataFrame in Python?

Q5. How can you handle duplicate values in a dataset for a variable in Python?
Consider the following Python code:
bill_data=pd.read_csv("datasetsTelecom Data AnalysisBill.csv")
bill_data.shape
#Identify duplicates records in the data
Dupes = bill_data.duplicated()
sum(dupes)
#Removing Duplicates
bill_data_uniq = bill_data.drop_duplicates()
Q6. Write a basic Machine Learning program to check the accuracy of a model, by importing any dataset using any classifier?
#importing dataset
import sklearn
from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data
Y = iris.target
 
#splitting the dataset
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test = train_test_split(X,Y, test_size = 0.5)
 
#Selecting Classifier
my_classifier = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
My_classifier.fit(X_train, Y_train)
predictions = my_classifier(X_test)
#check accuracy
From sklear.metrics import accuracy_score
print accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
Machine Learning Scenario Based Questions
This set of Machine Learning interview questions deal with scenario-based Machine Learning questions.
Q1. You are given a data set consisting of variables having more than 30% missing values? Let’s say, out of 50 variables, 8 variables have missing values higher than 30%. How will you deal with them?
Assign a unique category to the missing values, who knows the missing values might uncover some trend.
We can remove them blatantly.
Or, we can sensibly check their distribution with the target variable, and if found any pattern we’ll keep those missing values and assign them a new category while removing others.
Q2. Write an SQL query that makes recommendations using the pages that your friends liked. Assume you have two tables: a two-column table of users and their friends, and a two-column table of users and the pages they liked. It should not recommend pages you already like.
SELECT f.user_id, l.page_id
FROM friend f JOIN like l
ON f.friend_id = l.user_id
WHERE l.page_id NOT IN (SELECT page_id FROM like
WHERE user_id = f.user_id)
Q3. There’s a game where you are asked to roll two fair six-sided dice. If the sum of the values on the dice equals seven, then you win $21. However, you must pay $5 to play each time you roll both dice. Do you play this game? And in the follow-up: If he plays 6 times what is the probability of making money from this game?
The first condition states that if the sum of the values on the 2 dices is equal to 7, then you win $21. But for all the other cases you must pay $5.
First, let’s calculate the number of possible cases. Since we have two 6-sided dices, the total number of cases => 6*6 = 36.
Out of 36 cases, we must calculate the number of cases that produces a sum of 7 (in such a way that the sum of the values on the 2 dices is equal to 7)
Possible combinations that produce a sum of 7 is, (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2) and (6,1). All these 6 combinations generate a sum of 7.
This means that out of 36 chances, only 6 will produce a sum of 7. On taking the ratio, we get: 6/36 = 1/6
So this suggests that we have a chance of winning $21, once in 6 games.
So to answer the question if a person plays 6 times, he will win one game of $21, whereas for the other 5 games he will have to pay $5 each, which is $25 for all five games. Therefore, he will face a loss because he wins $21 but ends up paying $25.
Q4. We have two options for serving ads within Newsfeed:
1 — out of every 25 stories, one will be an ad
2 — every story has a 4% chance of being an ad
For each option, what is the expected number of ads shown in 100 news stories?
If we go with option 2, what is the chance a user will be shown only a single ad in 100 stories? What about no ads at all?
The expected number of ads shown in 100 new stories for option 1 is equal to 4 (100/25 = 4).
Similarly, for option 2, the expected number of ads shown in 100 new stories is also equal to 4 (4/100 = 1/25 which suggests that one out of every 25 stories will be an ad, therefore in 100 new stories there will be 4 ads)
Therefore for each option, the total number of ads shown in 100 new stories is 4.
The second part of the question can be solved by using Binomial distribution. Binomial distribution takes three parameters:
The probability of success and failure, which in our case is 4%.
The total number of cases, which is 100 in our case.
The probability of the outcome, which is a chance that a user will be shown only a single ad in 100 stories
p(single ad) = (0.96)⁹⁹*(0.04)¹
(note: here 0.96 denotes the chance of not seeing an ad in 100 stories, 99 denotes the possibility of seeing only 1 ad, 0.04 is the probability of seeing an ad once in 100 stories )
In total, there are 100 positions for the ad. Therefore, 100 * p(single ad) = 7.03%
Q5. How would you predict who will renew their subscription next month? What data would you need to solve this? What analysis would you do? Would you build predictive models? If so, which algorithms?
Let’s assume that we’re trying to predict renewal rate for Netflix subscription. So our problem statement is to predict which users will renew their subscription plan for the next month.
Next, we must understand the data that is needed to solve this problem. In this case, we need to check the number of hours the channel is active for each household, the number of adults in the household, number of kids, which channels are streamed the most, how much time is spent on each channel, how much has the watch rate varied from last month, etc. Such data is needed to predict whether or not a person will continue the subscription for the upcoming month.
After collecting this data, it is important that you find patterns and correlations. For example, we know that if a household has kids, then they are more likely to subscribe. Similarly, by studying the watch rate of the previous month, you can predict whether a person is still interested in a subscription. Such trends must be studied.
The next step is analysis. For this kind of problem statement, you must use a classification algorithm that classifies customers into 2 groups:
Customers who are likely to subscribe next month
Customers who are not likely to subscribe next month
Would you build predictive models? Yes, in order to achieve this you must build a predictive model that classifies the customers into 2 classes like mentioned above.
Which algorithms to choose? You can choose classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, etc.
Once you’ve opted the right algorithm, you must perform model evaluation to calculate the efficiency of the algorithm. This is followed by deployment.
Q6. How do you map nicknames (Pete, Andy, Nick, Rob, etc) to real names?
This problem can be solved in n number of ways. Let’s assume that you’re given a data set containing 1000s of twitter interactions. You will begin by studying the relationship between two people by carefully analyzing the words used in the tweets.
This kind of problem statement can be solved by implementing Text Mining using Natural Language Processing techniques, wherein each word in a sentence is broken down and co-relations between various words are found.
NLP is actively used in understanding customer feedback, performing sentimental analysis on Twitter and Facebook. Thus, one of the ways to solve this problem is through Text Mining and Natural Language Processing techniques.
Q7. A jar has 1000 coins, of which 999 are fair and 1 is double headed. Pick a coin at random, and toss it 10 times. Given that you see 10 heads, what is the probability that the next toss of that coin is also a head?
There are two ways of choosing a coin. One is to pick a fair coin and the other is to pick the one with two heads.
Probability of selecting fair coin = 999/1000 = 0.999
Probability of selecting unfair coin = 1/1000 = 0.001
Selecting 10 heads in a row = Selecting fair coin * Getting 10 heads + Selecting an unfair coin
P (A) = 0.999 * (1/2)¹⁰ = 0.999 * (1/1024) = 0.000976
P (B) = 0.001 * 1 = 0.001
P( A / A + B ) = 0.000976 / (0.000976 + 0.001) = 0.4939
P( B / A + B ) = 0.001 / 0.001976 = 0.5061
Probability of selecting another head = P(A/A+B) * 0.5 + P(B/A+B) * 1 = 0.4939 * 0.5 + 0.5061 = 0.7531
Q8. Suppose you are given a data set which has missing values spread along 1 standard deviation from the median. What percentage of data would remain unaffected and Why?
Since the data is spread across the median, let’s assume it’s a normal distribution.
As you know, in a normal distribution, ~68% of the data lies in 1 standard deviation from mean (or mode, median), which leaves ~32% of the data unaffected. Therefore, ~32% of the data would remain unaffected by missing values.
Q9. You are given a cancer detection data set. Let’s suppose when you build a classification model you achieved an accuracy of 96%. Why shouldn’t you be happy with your model performance? What can you do about it?
You can do the following:
Add more data
Treat missing outlier values
Feature Engineering
Feature Selection
Multiple Algorithms
Algorithm Tuning
Ensemble Method
Cross-Validation
Q10. You are working on a time series data set. Your manager has asked you to build a high accuracy model. You start with the decision tree algorithm since you know it works fairly well on all kinds of data. Later, you tried a time series regression model and got higher accuracy than the decision tree model. Can this happen? Why?
Time series data is based on linearity while a decision tree algorithm is known to work best to detect non-linear interactions
Decision tree fails to provide robust predictions. Why?
The reason is that it couldn’t map the linear relationship as good as a regression model did.
We also know that a linear regression model can provide a robust prediction only if the data set satisfies its linearity assumptions.
Q11. Suppose you found that your model is suffering from low bias and high variance. Which algorithm you think could tackle this situation and Why?
Type 1: How to tackle high variance?
Low bias occurs when the model’s predicted values are near to actual values.
In this case, we can use the bagging algorithm (eg: Random Forest) to tackle high variance problem.
Bagging algorithm will divide the data set into its subsets with repeated randomized sampling.
Once divided, these samples can be used to generate a set of models using a single learning algorithm. Later, the model predictions are combined using voting (classification) or averaging (regression).
Type 2: How to tackle high variance?
Lower the model complexity by using regularization technique, where higher model coefficients get penalized.
You can also use top n features from variable importance chart. It might be possible that with all the variable in the data set, the algorithm is facing difficulty in finding the meaningful signal.
Q12. You are given a data set. The data set contains many variables, some of which are highly correlated and you know about it. Your manager has asked you to run PCA. Would you remove correlated variables first? Why?
Possibly, you might get tempted to say no, but that would be incorrect.
Discarding correlated variables will have a substantial effect on PCA because, in the presence of correlated variables, the variance explained by a particular component gets inflated.
Q13. You are asked to build a multiple regression model but your model R² isn’t as good as you wanted. For improvement, you remove the intercept term now your model R² becomes 0.8 from 0.3. Is it possible? How?
Yes, it is possible.
The intercept term refers to model prediction without any independent variable or in other words, mean prediction
R² = 1 — ∑(Y — Y´)²/∑(Y — Ymean)² where Y´ is the predicted value.
In the presence of the intercept term, R² value will evaluate your model with respect to the mean model.
In the absence of the intercept term (Ymean), the model can make no such evaluation,
With large denominator,
Value of ∑(Y — Y´)²/∑(Y)² equation becomes smaller than actual, thereby resulting in a higher value of R².
Q14. You’re asked to build a random forest model with 10000 trees. During its training, you got training error as 0.00. But, on testing the validation error was 34.23. What is going on? Haven’t you trained your model perfectly?
The model is overfitting the data.
Training error of 0.00 means that the classifier has mimicked the training data patterns to an extent.
But when this classifier runs on the unseen sample, it was not able to find those patterns and returned the predictions with more number of errors.
In Random Forest, it usually happens when we use a larger number of trees than necessary. Hence, to avoid such situations, we should tune the number of trees using cross-validation.
Q15. ‘People who bought this also bought…’ recommendations seen on Amazon is based on which algorithm?
E-commerce websites like Amazon make use of Machine Learning to recommend products to their customers. The basic idea of this kind of recommendation comes from collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is the process of comparing users with similar shopping behaviors in order to recommend products to a new user with similar shopping behavior.
To better understand this, let’s look at an example. Let’s say a user A who is a sports enthusiast bought, pizza, pasta, and a coke. Now a couple of weeks later, another user B who rides a bicycle buys pizza and pasta. He does not buy the coke, but Amazon recommends a bottle of coke to user B since his shopping behaviors and his lifestyle is quite similar to user A. This is how collaborative filtering works.

Machine Learning is a concept which allows the machine to learn from examples and experience, and that too without being explicitly programmed. This article will help you to understand the following topics:

Understanding Machine Learning with an Analogy
As a Human: Let’s suppose one day you went shopping mangoes. The vendor had a cart full of mangoes from where you could handpick the mangoes, get them weighed and pay according to the rate fixed per Kg.

Task: How will you choose the best mangoes?
Given below is set of learning, human gains from his experience of shopping mangoes, you can drill it down to have a further look at it in detail. Go through it once, you will relate it to machine learning very easily.
Learning 1: Bright Yellow Mangoes are sweeter than the pale yellow ones.
Experience 1:
You were informed that bright and yellow mangoes are sweeter than pale and yellow ones.
So you make a simple rule: pick only from the bright yellow mangoes. You check the color of the mangoes, pick the bright yellow ones, pay up, and return home. Right?
Learning 2: The smaller and the bright yellow mangoes are sweet only half the time.
Experience 2:
Now when you went home and tasted the mangoes, some of them were not sweet as you thought. You are worried as your wisdom was insufficient. You concluded that when it comes shopping mangoes, you have to look for more than just the colours.
After a lot of pondering and tasting different types of mangoes, you concluded that the bigger and bright yellow mangoes are guaranteed to be sweet, while the smaller, bright yellow mangoes are sweet only half the time (i.e. if you bought 100 bright yellow mangoes (50 will be big in size and rest 50 will be small), then the 50 big mangoes will all be sweet, while out of the 50 small ones, only 25 mangoes will turn out to be sweet). You will then update your rule about the mango shopping and from next time you will keep this in mind.
Learning 3: Small, pale yellow ones are the sweetest of all.
Experience 3:
Tragedy: Next time at the market, you see that your favorite vendor has gone out of town. You decide to buy from a different vendor, who supplies mangoes grown from a different part of the country. Now, you realize that the rule which you had learned (that big, bright yellow mangoes are the sweetest) is no longer applicable. You have to learn from scratch. You taste a mango of each kind from this vendor and realize that the small, pale yellow ones are in fact the sweetest of all.
Learning 4: Soft mangoes are juicier.
Experience 4:
One day your cousin visits you from another city. You decide to treat her with mangoes. But she is like “I don’t care about the sweetness of a mango, I only want the juiciest ones”. Now once again, you run your experiments, tasting all kinds of mangoes, and realizing that the softer ones are juicier.
Learning 5: Green Mangoes are tastier than the yellow ones.
Experience 5:
Later on, you move to a different part of the world and you found that the mangoes here taste surprisingly different from your home country. You realized that for this country the green mangoes are tastier than the yellow ones.
Learning 6: You do not need mangoes anymore.
Experience 6:
You marry someone who hates mangoes but loves oranges instead. Now you go shopping oranges instead of mangoes. Now, all your accumulated knowledge about mangoes is worthless. Now you have to learn everything about the correlation between the physical characteristics and the taste of apples, by the same method of experimentation.
What if you have to write a code for it?
As a Human Written Code: Now, imagine you were asked to write a computer program to choose your mangoes (or oranges). You might write the following rules/algorithm:
if is bright yellow and size is big and sold by: mango is sweet.
if (soft): mango is juicy
You would use these rules to choose the mangoes.
Conclusion as a human:
But every time you make a new observation from your experiments, you have to modify the list of rules manually.
You have to understand the details of all the factors affecting the quality of mangoes. If the problem gets complicated enough, it might get difficult for you to make accurate rules by hand that covers all possible types of mangoes. This will take a lot of research and effort and not everyone has this amount of time.
This is where Machine Learning comes into the picture
What is Machine Learning?
Definition:
Machine Learning is a concept that allows the machine to learn from examples and experience, and that too without being explicitly programmed. So instead of you writing the code, what you do is you feed data to the generic algorithm, and the algorithm/machine builds the logic based on the given data.

Machine Learning algorithms are an evolution of normal algorithms. They make your programs “smarter”, by allowing them to automatically learn from the data you provide. The algorithm is mainly divided into:
Training Phase
Testing phase
Training Phase
You take a randomly selected specimen of mangoes from the market (training data), make a table of all the physical characteristics of each mango, like color, size, shape, grown in which part of the country, sold by which vendor, etc (features), along with the sweetness, juiciness, ripeness of that mango (output variables). You feed this data to the machine learning algorithm (classification/regression), and it learns a model of the correlation between an average mango’s physical characteristics, and its quality.
Testing Phase

Next time when you go shopping, you will measure the characteristics of the mangoes which you are purchasing(test data)and feed it to the Machine Learning algorithm. It will use the model which was computed earlier to predict if the mangoes are sweet, ripe and/or juicy. The algorithm may internally use the rules, similar to the one you manually wrote earlier (for eg, a decision tree). Finally, you can now shop for mangoes with great confidence, without worrying about the details of how to choose the best mangoes.
Conclusion as an Algorithm
You know what! you can make your algorithm improve over time (reinforcement learning) so that it will improve its accuracy as it gets trained on more and more training dataset. In case it makes a wrong prediction it will update its rule by itself.
The best part of this is, you can use the same algorithm to train different models. You can create one each for predicting the quality of apples, grapes, bananas, or whatever you want.
Biggest Confusion AI vs ML vs Deep Learning
Let’s move ahead in this Machine Learning tutorial and discuss one of the biggest confusion. People think all three of them the AI, ML, and Deep Learning are same. But this is WRONG!, let me clarify things for you.
Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a smarter way. It covers anything which enables computers to behave like humans.
Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of AI and is based on the idea that machines should be given access to data, and should be left to learn and explore for themselves. It deals with the extraction of patterns from large data sets.
Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning where similar Machine Learning Algorithms are used to train Deep Neural Networks so as to achieve better accuracy in those cases where former was not performing up to the mark.
Let’s categorize Machine Learning into its subparts and see what each of them are, how they work, and how each one of them is used in real life.
Starting with Supervised Learning, So what is it?
Understanding Supervised Learning
Let’s see the mathematical definition of Supervised Learning.
Supervised learning is the one where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output. it,
Y = f(X)
The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that whenever you get some new input data (x), the machine can easily predict the output variables (Y) for that data.

Let me rephrase you this in simple terms:
In Supervised machine learning algorithm, every instance of the training dataset consists of input attributes and expected output. The training dataset can take any kind of data as input like values of a database row, the pixels of an image, or even an audio frequency histogram.
Now let me tell you why this category of machine learning is termed as supervised learning?
This category is termed as supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher teaching his students. The algorithm continuously predicts the result on the basis of training data and is continuously corrected by the teacher. The learning continues until the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.
Supervised Learning Use-cases
Cortana

Cortana or any speech automated system in your mobile phone trains your voice and then starts working based on this training. This is an application of Supervised Learning
Weather Apps

Predicts the upcoming weather by analyzing the parameters for a given time on some prior knowledge (when its sunny, temperature is higher; when its cloudy, humidity is higher, etc.).
Biometric Attendance

In Biometric Attendance you can train the machine with inputs of your biometric identity — it can be your thumb, iris or ear-lobe, etc. Once the machine is trained it can validate your future input and can easily identify you.
Understanding Unsupervised Learning
So, what is Unsupervised Learning?
Mathematically, Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.
The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.

Let me rephrase it for you in simple terms:
In the unsupervised learning approach, the sample of a training dataset does not have an expected output associated with them. Using the unsupervised learning algorithms you can detect patterns based on the typical characteristics of the input data. Clustering can be considered as an example of a machine learning task that uses the unsupervised learning approach. The machine then groups similar data samples and identify different clusters within the data.
Now let me tell you why this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised learning?
Well, this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised because unlike supervised learning there is no teacher. Algorithms are left on their own to discover and return the interesting structure in the data.
Unsupervised Learning Usecases

A friend invites you to his party where you meet totally strangers. Now you will classify them using unsupervised learning (no prior knowledge) and this classification can be on the basis of gender, age group, dressing, educational qualification or whatever way you would like. Since you didn’t have any prior knowledge about people and so you just classified them “on-the-go”.
Let’s suppose you have never seen a Football match before and by chance watch a video on the internet, now you can classify players on the basis of different criterion like Players wearing the same sort of kits are in one class, Players of one style are in one class (players, goalkeeper, referee), or on the basis of playing style(attacker or defender) or whatever way you would observe, you can classify it.
Understanding Reinforcement Learning
So, what is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement learning can be thought of as a hit and trial method of learning. The machine gets a Reward or Penalty point for each action it performs. If the option is correct, the machine gains the reward point or gets a penalty point in case of a wrong response.

The reinforcement learning algorithm is all about the interaction between the environment and the learning agent. The learning agent is based on exploration and exploitation.
Exploration is when the learning agent acts on trial and error and Exploitation is when it performs an action based on the knowledge gained from the environment. The environment rewards the agent for every correct action, which is the reinforcement signal. With the aim of collecting more rewards obtained, the agent improves its environment knowledge to choose or perform the next action.
Let see how Pavlov trained his dog using reinforcement training?
Pavlov divided the training of his dog into four stages.
In the first part, Pavlov gave meat to the dog, and in response to the meat, the dog started salivating.
In the next stage he created a sound with a bell, but this time the dogs did not respond to anything.
In the third stage, he tried to train his dog by using the bell and then giving them food. Seeing the food the dog started salivating.
Eventually, the dogs started salivating just after hearing the bell, even if the food was not given as the dog was reinforced that whenever the master will ring the bell, he will get the food.
Onsite interview:
Machine learning theory round
Machine learning system design
Machine learning coding
1) Machine learning technical assessment
Typically, big-tech companies have a 1-hour technical phone screen that comprises 1 leetcode style question followed by 10 to 15 mins of rapid-fire ML tech questions towards the end. Some of these questions include:
Explain overfitting and regularization
Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.
How do you handle data imbalance issues?
Explain Gradient descent and Stochastic gradient descent. Which one would you prefer?
[Difficult] Can you explain logistic regression and derive gradient descent for Logistic regression
[Difficult] What do eigenvalues and eigenvectors mean in PCA
[Difficult] Explain different types of Optimizers — How is Adam optimizer different from Rmsprop?
[Difficult] What are the different types of activation functions and explain about vanishing gradient problem>
I’ve compiled a set of commonly asked ML Theory questions over here.
How should you prepare for this round
This round is quite crucial because it tests your basic understanding of common topics in ML. Instead of approaching these questions by studying a cheat sheet, I’d recommend spending a week or two going over the basics from a textbook. I highly recommend this textbook and this Coursera course which you can watch in 1.5X speed. Often, even textbooks don’t do a good job of explaining nuanced concepts like Optimizers. In this case, picking up good articles on Medium.com was something that was very useful for my prep. For example, here’s a great article that explains different types of optimizers and does a much better job than the textbooks I’ve read. Aim to spend around 2 weeks to a month revising Machine learning basics.
Onsite — Machine Learning Theory Round
This round is quite similar to the above technical assessment round and has 45 min to 1 hour dedicated to it. The objective of this round is more to test your waters and distinguish between an ML modeling engineer and vs. ML Infra engineer (Often it is not quite easy to make that distinction from the resume). You can expect two kinds of questions. For example:
Straightforward theory questions:
What do L1 and L2 regularization mean and when would you use L1 vs. L2? Can you use both?
When there are highly correlated features in your dataset, how would the weights for L1 and L2 end up being?
Nuanced derivation-based questions that requires a pen and paper:
Can you use MSE for evaluating your classification problem instead of Cross entropy
How does the loss curve for Cross entropy look?
What does the “minus” in cross-entropy mean?
Explain how Momentum differs from RMS prop optimizer?
Aim to spend the bulk of your preparation going back to basics and getting the concepts right. I spent >2 weeks revising machine learning concepts. Getting the derivations practiced with pen and paper makes a huge difference. While textbooks are a good source to know how to answer theory questions, if your understanding needs a little bit more work — Youtube videos are a game changer. 50% of my ML theory prep were on Youtube videos, and 50% were on the textbook (more for perfecting the answers). Here’s my youtube playlist that I keep going back to, the evening before my onsite interviews.
Onsite Interview — How to tackle the ML system design round?
Now, this is the round that few companies manage to conduct well. Finding calibrated interviewers and having the right set of rubrics for evaluating candidates is quite challenging for this round. Some of the companies I interviewed at like Google, Meta, Airbnb, and Doordash had a mature process for ML System design.
For ML Design, the expectation from candidates is often not clear and I’ve found interviewers asking questions that are quite large in scope, leaving little room for going in depth. So it is crucial that candidates remember to clarify expectations by asking questions like:
Do we care about Model deployment and the system design of how ML infra works?
Do we care about going deep into modeling choices?
What are the different business objectives that we want to optimize and why do we care about them?
Its also a game changer for candidates to assert and establish what you plan to cover at the outset, so there’s minimal interruptions, for e.g
I always say at the start “Here’s the structure I plan to follow [I jot down 4–5 bullet points], please let me know if you’d like me to cover these in a different order or touch on any of this more than the others”.
L4 candidates don’t typically have an ML design round, for L5 you can expect 1–2 rounds and for L6 there’s a minimum of 2 rounds expected.
Expect questions like
Design a feed recommendation system
Design Youtube(Google)
Design Google contact ranking(Google)
Design an item replacement recommendation(Instacart)
Design an ML System to optimize coupon distribution with a set budget(Netflix).
Here are top tips for nailing this round
Have a good pre-defined structure for the interview. Here’s my recommended structure:

Have a good script for answering any ML Design question. Pretty much every ML design question fits into the above structure and the script can also be somewhat generalized. Here’s my pdf [Credit: Hesam Salehian] on how I approach recommendation systems; You can also rely on online machine learning design resources like this course for help with different types of design questions. I’ve shared more templates and case studies here.
How to salvage a derail?
Say you are 10 mins into the design interview and the interviewer asks you a question on Business metrics and you spend an excessive amount of time in that section; how do you salvage your interview?
This is something I noticed far too often especially in ML Design interviews. This is often a function of your interviewer having a pre-defined structure in their mind that collides with your structure. for e.g, If you start speaking about online metrics and they want to know about Training data — Take a pause, make it explicit to the interviewer that this is the structure you intend to follow, and get back on track.
Design interviews should typically be led by the candidate with minimal interruptions from the interviewer. So, take ownership here fully knowing that the interviewer on the other end is probably not calibrated and hence it is entirely up to you to utilize your 45 mins to give as much signal as possible.
It is also quite possible that the interviewer would want to probe for more signals in a specific area. In which case, ask explicitly “Should I go deep into explaining the modeling section now or would you want me to just touch on it” → Often you’d get a very objective answer which will throw light on what is the interviewer expecting from you.
The best way to prepare for ML design rounds is to take as many mock interviews as possible. I took 5 ML mock interviews with my friends which really helped shape my run-book for this round. This brings me to the end of Part 1. In Part 2, I deep dive into types of ML Design questions and the rubric that differentiates an L4 candidate vs. L5 and L6 (Meta levels).

Q1 Explain different types of machine learning with their pros and cons?
They are classified into 4 categories : Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-Supervised and Reinforcement Learning.
1.Supervised Learning : Deals with “Labelled data” as input and based on that generates an corresponding output.
Pros : Have an exact idea about classes in training data, Simple process and easy to interpret.
Cons : In the case of classification, if we give an input that is not from any of the classes in the training data, then the output may be a wrong class label, training needs a lot of computation time, so do the classification, especially if the data set is very large.
2.Unsupervised Learning : Deal with “Un-Labelled data” so the main aim here is to group or categories the unsorted dataset according to the similarities, patterns, and differences. Machines are instructed to find the hidden patterns from the input dataset.
Pros : Unlabeled data can be easily made available, lesser complexity compared to the supervised learning task, Identify hidden patterns which humans is difficult to visualize.
Cons : Most of times having low accuracy, It is costlier because it requires human intervention to correlated data with domain knowledge.
3.Semi-Supervised Learning : Training data comprises of both labelled and unlabeled data. Steps of working are below :
Firstly, it trains the model with less amount of training data similar to the supervised learning models. The training continues until the model gives accurate results.
The algorithms use the unlabeled dataset with pseudo labels in the next step, and now the result may not be accurate.
Now, the labels from labeled training data and pseudo labels data are linked together.
The input data in labeled training data and unlabeled training data are also linked.
In the end, again train the model with the new combined input as did in the first step. It will reduce errors and improve the accuracy of the model.
Assumptions:
Continuity Assumption: The objects near each other tend to share the same group or label. This assumption is also used in supervised learning, and the datasets are separated by the decision boundaries. But in semi-supervised, the decision boundaries are added with the smoothness assumption in low-density boundaries.
Cluster assumptions: Data is divided into different discrete clusters. Further, the points in the same cluster share the output label.
Manifold assumptions: This assumption helps to use distances and densities, and this data lie on a manifold of fewer dimensions than input space.
The dimensional data are created by a process that has less degree of freedom and may be hard to model directly. (This assumption becomes practical if high).
4. Reinforcement Learning: Here agent learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of actions. For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, the agent gets negative feedback or penalty. There is no labelled data so, agent is bound to learn from experience only.
Q2 What is difference between Regression and Classification ?

Key Difference Between Regression & Classification
Q3 What is difference between Structure & Unstructured Data ?
Structured Data : Structured data stand for the information that is highly factual, organized and to the point. eg — SQL Data base, Spreadsheets, OLTP system, Online Forms.
Unstructured Data : Unstructured data does not have any pre-defined structure to it and comes in all its diversity of forms eg — Images, Videos, Audio, Reports.
Q4. What are assumption of Linear Regression ?
Linear Relationship between input and output
No Multicollinearity
Normality of residual
Homoscedasticity
No auto-correlation of errors
Q5. What is multicollinearity and why it is a problem in linear regression ?
Multicollinearity exist when an independent variable is highly correlated with another independent variable in multiple regression equation.
This can be problematic because it undermines the statistical significance of an independent variable.
You can use the Variation Inflation Factors(VIF) to determine if there is any multicollinearity between independent variables — if VIF is greater than 5 then multicollinearity exists.

Variation Inflation Factor (VIF)
Eg : y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 +c
Ideally x1,x2,x3 should be independent but if we increase values of x1 then value of x2 also increase/decreases which concludes multicollinearity exists. As per linear regression, m1 represents if we make changes in m1 then what changes can be observed in y and other will be constant. However, this will not work when multicollinearity exists. So, it violates linear regression.
Q6. In linear regression, what is the value of the sum of the residuals for a given dataset?
Normality assumption: It is assumed that the error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed.
Zero mean assumption: It is assumed that the residuals have a mean value of zero.
Constant variance assumption: It is assumed that the residual terms have the same (but unknown) variance, σ2 This assumption is also known as the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity.
Independent error assumption: It is assumed that the residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance is zero.
We can plot KDE plot and check whether it is normal bell shapes curve or not. Also, we can plot Q-Q plot and check what line is crossing max points or not.
Q7. What is homoscedasticity & Heteroscedasticity ?
Homoscedasticity means to be of “The same Variance” or “same scatter”. In other words, Linear Regression assumes that for all the instances, the error terms will be the same and of very little variance.

Homoscedasticity

Heteroscedasticity
Heteroscedasticity refers to data for which the variance of the dependent variable is unequal across the range of independent variables. A regression model assumes a consistent variance, or homoscedasticity, across the data.
Heteroscedasticity in the data results in regression providing accurate outputs on one end of the data range but highly inaccurate outputs on the other end of the data. An easy way to visualize these concepts is to create a scatter plot of the data.
A heteroscedastic data set will exhibit a conical shape across the range of independent variables. The wider the cone, the more heteroscedastic the data is and the less friendly for regression analysis.
It is important to understand that a regression analysis on the data set is still possible but the results will prove unreliable outside of a specific range.
Q8. What are the reasons and effect of Heteroscedasticity on model ?
Reasons for Heteroscedasticity :
When you are fitting the wrong model. If you fit a linear regression model to a data which is non-linear, it will lead to Heteroscedasticity.
When the is large variance in machine learning model.
When the scale of values in a variable is not the same.
When a wrong transformation on data is used for regression.
When there is left/right skewness present in the data.
Effect of Heteroscedasticity :
Presence of Heteroscedasticity makes the coefficients less precise and hence the correct coefficients are further away from the population value.
Heteroscedasticity is also likely to produce p-values smaller than the actual values. This is due to the fact that the variance of coefficient estimates has increased but the standard OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) model did not detect it. Therefore the OLS model calculates p-values using an underestimated variance. This can lead us to incorrectly make a conclusion that the regression coefficients are significant when they are actually not significant.
The standard errors produced will also be biased. Standard errors are crucial in calculating significant tests and confidence intervals. If the Standard errors are biased, it will mean that the tests are incorrect and the regression coefficient estimates will be incorrect.
Q9. How to handle problem of Heteroscedasticity on model ?
Manipulating the variables
We can make some modifications to the variables/features we have to reduce the impact of this large variance on the model predictions.
Weighted Regression
Weighted regression is a modification of normal regression where the data points are assigned certain weights according to their variance. The ones with large variance are given small weights and the ones with less variance are given larger weights.
So when these weights are squared, the square of small weights underestimates the effect of high variance.
When correct weights are used, Heteroscedasticity is replaced by Homoscedasticity. But how to find correct weights? One quick way is to use the inverse of that variable as the weight.
Transformation
Use Box-Cox transformations and log transformations.

1. How do generative and discriminative classifiers differ? Examples? When to prefer generative classifiers?
Difference: Generative classifiers model the data distribution P(X,Y)P(X, Y)P(X,Y), while discriminative classifiers focus only on the decision boundary P(Y∣X)P(Y|X)P(Y∣X).
Examples: Generative - Naive Bayes, GMM; Discriminative - Logistic Regression, SVM.
When to prefer: Generative classifiers are better when the dataset is small, when you need probabilistic outputs, or when handling missing data.

2. How is K-Fold Cross Validation used to find the best hyperparameters for a model?
The dataset is split into KKK equal parts (folds).
Train on K−1K-1K−1 folds and validate on the remaining one, repeating this process KKK times.
Hyperparameters are tuned based on the average validation score across folds, ensuring better generalization.

3. How to handle class imbalance problems for a binary classifier?
Resampling techniques: Oversample the minority class (e.g., SMOTE) or undersample the majority class.
Adjust class weights: Use algorithms that allow weighted loss functions to penalize errors in the minority class more.
Use specialized models: Techniques like ensemble methods (e.g., boosting) inherently handle imbalance well.

4. Explain ROC and AUC. How to compute AUC for a multi-class classifier?
ROC: A curve showing the tradeoff between the true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate at different thresholds.
AUC: The area under the ROC curve; measures how well the model separates classes (1 is perfect, 0.5 is random).
Multi-class AUC: Compute one-vs-all AUC for each class or average pairwise comparisons between classes.

5. When to use the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and why?
Use it when:
You’re working with data that has hidden or latent variables (e.g., GMMs for clustering).
Data is incomplete or has missing values.
Why: EM alternates between assigning probabilities to hidden variables (E-step) and updating model parameters (M-step) to maximize the likelihood.

6. How to choose the optimum number of clusters with K-Means clustering?
Elbow Method: Plot the WCSS (within-cluster sum of squares) against the number of clusters. The "elbow point" indicates the optimal number.
Silhouette Score: Measures how similar points in a cluster are to points in other clusters (higher is better).
Gap Statistic: Compares clustering performance to random data distribution.

7. How does bias and variance change with an increasing number of clusters in K-Means?
More clusters: Reduces bias as the model can better fit the data, but increases variance, leading to overfitting.
Fewer clusters: Increases bias, as it oversimplifies the data, but reduces variance, improving generalization.

8. What are the advantages of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) over K-Means?
GMMs can model non-spherical clusters, unlike K-Means, which assumes clusters are spherical.
GMMs provide soft clustering, assigning probabilities to each cluster for a point, rather than a hard assignment.
They handle uncertainty in data better.

9. When would you choose Hierarchical Clustering over K-Means and vice versa?
Hierarchical:
When you need a hierarchy or dendrogram to understand relationships between clusters.
For smaller datasets since it’s computationally expensive for large datasets.
K-Means:
When you know the number of clusters and have large datasets.
It’s faster and works well with spherical clusters.

10. What is the ‘Naive’ Bayes assumption?
It assumes that all features are conditionally independent given the class label.
This simplifies computation by treating the probability of each feature independently.
While this assumption is rarely true in real-world data, Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well due to its simplicity and efficiency.
11. You come to know that your model is suffering from low bias and high variance. Which algorithm should you use to tackle it? Why?
Use ensemble methods like Random Forest or boosting to reduce variance.
Why: These methods aggregate predictions from multiple models, reducing overfitting. Adding regularization (e.g., L1/L2) can also help.

12. Should you remove correlated variables before running PCA? If not, how does PCA handle them?
No need to remove correlated variables.
Why: PCA identifies correlated features and combines them into principal components, effectively reducing redundancy.

13. How do you interpret p-value for a model?
The p-value tells whether a feature's coefficient significantly contributes to the model.
A small p-value (e.g., < 0.05) indicates strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis, meaning the feature is significant.

14. What is the Central Limit Theorem? How does it help in ML?
CLT: For large sample sizes, the sample mean follows a normal distribution, regardless of the population’s distribution.
In ML: It’s the basis for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, helping with assumptions about data distributions.

15. What is the difference between covariance and correlation?
Covariance: Measures how two variables vary together (scale-dependent).
Correlation: A normalized version of covariance, showing the strength and direction of the relationship (range: -1 to 1).

16. What do you understand by eigenvectors and eigenvalues?
Eigenvectors: Directions in which data variance is maximized.
Eigenvalues: Amount of variance captured along an eigenvector.
In ML: Used in PCA to identify key dimensions in data.

17. How do you know whether a loss function has a global minima or not?
If the loss function is convex (e.g., Mean Squared Error), it has a single global minimum.
For non-convex functions, optimization techniques like SGD may find local minima or saddle points.

18. How does SVM handle non-linear classification problems? Explain the Kernel Trick.
SVM maps data to a higher-dimensional space using kernels (e.g., RBF, polynomial) to make it linearly separable.
Kernel Trick: Computes inner products in higher-dimensional space efficiently, avoiding explicit transformations.

19. What is the role of the misclassification cost parameter CCC in SVM?
C controls the tradeoff between maximizing the margin and minimizing misclassification errors.
A high C prioritizes correct classification (low bias, high variance).
A low C increases the margin (high bias, low variance).

20. How do you find efficiently whether two classes are linearly separable?
Use a linear classifier like Logistic Regression or Linear SVM.
If they achieve perfect accuracy during training, the classes are likely linearly separable.

21. When would you prefer LinearSVM over Logistic Regression for a linearly separable binary classification problem?
Prefer LinearSVM when:
You need robust performance with outliers.
You prioritize maximizing the margin (better generalization).

22. For ranking recommendations, which would you choose: LinearSVM or Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression: Better for ranking as it outputs probabilities, which can be used to rank items.

23. Would SVM work well in high dimensions? Why or why not?
Yes, SVM works well in high dimensions because:
The kernel trick avoids explicit feature transformations.
It’s less prone to overfitting due to the margin-based approach.

24. What is the role of gamma in RBF kernels?
Gamma controls the influence of a single data point.
A small gamma captures global patterns, while a large gamma focuses on local patterns.

25. Why do we need a large margin classifier in SVM? Why wouldn’t any margin classifier work well?
A larger margin improves generalization by reducing overfitting.
Smaller margins can lead to overfitting, especially with noisy data.

26. How does a decision tree split a node?
It uses metrics like Gini Index or Information Gain to find the best split that maximizes class separation.

27. How to handle overfitting with a decision tree classifier?
Techniques:
Limit tree depth.
Set minimum samples per leaf node.
Use pruning (removing unnecessary branches).

28. Can decision trees be used for regression problems?
Yes, decision trees can predict continuous values by minimizing variance within splits instead of classification metrics.

29. How do Random Forests handle bias-variance tradeoffs?
By combining multiple decision trees:
Reduces variance (averaging predictions).
Maintains low bias (individual trees can capture complexity).

30. How are Gradient Boosted Trees different from Random Forests?
Random Forest: Builds trees independently and averages them.
Gradient Boosting: Builds trees sequentially, each focusing on errors of the previous one.
31. How to handle overfitting in Gradient Boosted Trees?
Techniques:
Use early stopping to halt training when validation error increases.
Add regularization (e.g., learning rate, max depth, L1/L2 penalties).
Reduce the number of trees or increase the minimum samples per leaf.

32. How to handle both numerical and categorical features with tree-based algorithms? What about ordinal features?
Numerical features: Used as-is since tree algorithms split data on numeric thresholds.
Categorical features: Convert to numerical using techniques like one-hot encoding or target encoding.
Ordinal features: Use their natural ordering directly in the tree.

33. Why and how does Random Forest prevent overfitting in decision trees?
Why: Random Forest reduces overfitting by combining predictions from multiple trees.
How:
Uses random subsets of data (bagging).
Splits nodes based on a random subset of features, reducing correlation between trees.

34. How does GBDTs decide to split a node? What does it minimize?
GBDTs split nodes to minimize the loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression, Log Loss for classification).
Each tree focuses on reducing the residual errors of the previous tree.

35. How to find feature importances with GBDTs?
Measure the reduction in the loss function from splitting on a feature across all trees.
Features contributing more to splits have higher importance scores.

36. How can GBDTs be used for feature transformation?
Use GBDT predictions (leaf node outputs) as new features for another model.
Commonly used in ensemble stacking.

37. What are the regularization factors in GBDTs?
Learning rate: Reduces the contribution of each tree.
Max depth: Prevents overly complex trees.
Min samples per leaf: Ensures splits have enough data points.
L1/L2 regularization: Penalizes large weights in the model.

38. How would you compute PCA of a feature matrix XXX?
Center the data (subtract the mean of each feature).
Compute the covariance matrix.
Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
Project data onto the top kkk eigenvectors (principal components).

39. What is the difference between PCA and SVD?
PCA: A dimensionality reduction technique based on eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
SVD: A matrix factorization technique that decomposes any matrix XXX into UΣVTU \Sigma V^TUΣVT. PCA is a special case of SVD applied to centered data.

40. How would you determine how many principal components to consider in PCA?
Look for the cumulative explained variance (e.g., select components explaining 95% of the variance).
Use a scree plot to identify the "elbow point."

41. Describe a situation where PCA is not a good method for dimensionality reduction.
When features are not linearly related (PCA assumes linear relationships).
When interpretability of features is crucial (PCA transforms features into combinations).

42. When do we need to standardize the variables before doing PCA?
Always standardize when features are on different scales (e.g., age in years and income in dollars).
Standardizing ensures that PCA doesn’t give undue weight to features with larger variances.

43. How would you use LSTM for Named Entity Recognition problems?
Use an LSTM to capture sequential dependencies in text.
Add a dense layer for classification at each time step to label entities.
Optionally, combine with CRFs for better sequence-level predictions.

44. Which one should you prefer for NER: LSTM only, Linear Chain CRF only, or LSTM + Linear Chain CRF? Why?
Prefer LSTM + CRF:
LSTM captures contextual information.
CRF ensures label consistency (e.g., avoids invalid sequences like "I-PER" followed by "B-LOC").

45. What problem does Bi-LSTM solve compared to only LSTM?
Bi-LSTM captures information from both past (left context) and future (right context), improving predictions for tasks like NER or translation.

46. What is the purpose of the pooling operation in CNNs?
Reduces spatial dimensions, retaining important features while making the model more computationally efficient.
Common types: Max Pooling (retains max value), Average Pooling (computes average).

47. How would you choose the number of filters and the filter size at each CNN layer?
Number of filters: Start small (e.g., 32 or 64) and increase for deeper layers.
Filter size: Use smaller filters (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) to capture finer details without overfitting.

48. How does Conv1D and MaxPool1D work?
Conv1D: Applies filters to 1D data (e.g., time series or text).
MaxPool1D: Reduces dimensionality by selecting the maximum value within a sliding window.

49. What are the advantages of parameter sharing in CNNs?
Reduces the number of parameters, making training faster and less prone to overfitting.
Captures spatial hierarchies efficiently.

50. How does CNN help in translation and rotation invariance of images?
Translation invariance: Achieved through local receptive fields and pooling layers.
Rotation invariance: Not inherent but can be achieved through data augmentation or specialized architectures.
51. How would you choose which layers to freeze and which to retrain in transfer learning?
Freeze early layers: These layers capture general features like edges and textures, which are useful across tasks.
Retrain later layers: These are task-specific and should be updated to learn features relevant to the new dataset.
If the new dataset is large, retrain more layers. For small datasets, freeze most layers to avoid overfitting.

52. What are some advantages of using character embeddings instead of word embeddings?
Handle out-of-vocabulary words: Character embeddings can represent unseen words by breaking them into subword units.
Better for morphologically rich languages: They capture prefixes, suffixes, and roots.
Robust to typos: Since they work at the character level, small spelling mistakes won’t significantly affect results.

53. How to train CNN models in parallel? Can LSTM models be trained in parallel? Why or why not?
CNNs: Can be trained in parallel because convolutions are independent for different filters and images.
LSTMs: Training is sequential because each step depends on the output of the previous step, making parallelization challenging.

54. Why are large filter sizes in early CNN layers a bad choice? How to choose filter size?
Large filters: They capture too much detail early, making the model less focused on small, meaningful patterns.
Better choice: Use smaller filters (e.g., 3x3) to capture local features and stack multiple layers to detect complex patterns.

55. Why are weights initialized with small random numbers in a neural network? What happens when weights are all 0 or constant values?
Small random initialization: Helps break symmetry so neurons learn diverse features.
All zeros: Leads to identical updates for all neurons in a layer, preventing them from learning independently.
Constant values: Causes a similar problem, as gradients will remain the same for all weights.

56. Why is the sigmoid activation not good? Why is ReLU or Tanh preferred?
Sigmoid drawbacks:
Outputs saturate at extremes, leading to vanishing gradients.
Produces outputs between 0 and 1, which are not zero-centered.
ReLU advantages: Simpler computation and avoids saturation for positive inputs.
Tanh: Zero-centered outputs, but still suffers from vanishing gradients for large inputs.

57. How to handle the dying ReLU problem in activation functions?
Dying ReLU occurs when neurons output zero for all inputs, effectively “dead.”
Solutions:
Use variants like Leaky ReLU (small positive slope for negative inputs).
Apply Batch Normalization to maintain gradient flow.

58. How does Dropout help in regularization? How is it different from L1 or L2 regularization?
Dropout: Randomly disables neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features.
Difference:
L1/L2 constrain weights to avoid overfitting.
Dropout prevents reliance on specific neurons, improving generalization.

59. When and why use Dropout instead of L1 or L2 regularization?
Use Dropout when:
The model is very deep and prone to overfitting.
You want to improve robustness by introducing noise during training.
L1/L2 are better for simpler models or when sparsity (L1) is desired.

60. When and why use Batch Normalization?
Use Batch Normalization to:
Normalize layer inputs, improving stability and convergence.
Reduce the dependence on careful weight initialization.
Act as a form of regularization, reducing overfitting.

61. How to handle vanishing gradient problems in neural networks?
Solutions:
Use activation functions like ReLU that don’t saturate.
Apply Batch Normalization to maintain consistent gradients.
Use residual connections (ResNets) to allow gradients to flow directly.

62. Why do we need the bias term in neural networks?
The bias term shifts the activation function, enabling the model to fit data that doesn’t pass through the origin.
Without bias, the network would have limited flexibility in fitting complex patterns.

63. What are the advantages and disadvantages of SGD over gradient descent?
Advantages:
Faster updates as it uses a single sample at a time.
Introduces noise, helping escape local minima.
Disadvantages:
Noisy updates can lead to slower convergence.
Requires careful tuning of the learning rate.

64. How does momentum help in SGD?
Momentum smoothens updates by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current one.
This accelerates convergence, especially in directions with consistent gradients, and helps overcome small local minima.

65. Would you use squared error loss or binary cross-entropy for binary classification? Why?
Binary cross-entropy is preferred because it:
Better handles probabilities and log-likelihood.
Avoids issues like vanishing gradients seen with squared error in this setting.

66. For online learning, which would you prefer: SGD or Adagrad? Why?
Prefer Adagrad for online learning because:
It adapts the learning rate for each parameter, reducing manual tuning.
Effective for sparse data as it adjusts learning rates dynamically.

67. How to train deep neural networks in a distributed manner? What are the advantages and disadvantages?
Methods:
Data parallelism: Split data across machines, each training a copy of the model.
Model parallelism: Split the model itself across machines.
Advantages:
Faster training by utilizing multiple machines.
Disadvantages:
Communication overhead between machines.
Complexity in synchronization.

68. How to handle the exploding gradient problem?
Use gradient clipping to cap gradients at a threshold.
Apply proper initialization techniques (e.g., Xavier or He initialization).
Use normalized architectures like Batch Normalization.

69. How does Batch Normalization differ during training and inference?
Training: Uses mini-batch statistics (mean, variance) for normalization.
Inference: Uses the moving average of batch statistics collected during training.

70. Why don’t we use Dropout during inference?
Dropout introduces randomness by disabling neurons, which is only useful during training.
During inference, all neurons are used, and Dropout scaling ensures consistent outputs.
71. Why do we need to shuffle data during training?
Shuffling ensures that the model doesn’t learn patterns based on the order of data (e.g., all "class A" samples appearing first followed by "class B").
Example: If training data for a stock price model is time-ordered, the model might mistakenly infer trends from order rather than data.

72. How can we alter the learning rate depending on the training loss? Is it okay to have a constant learning rate?
Adaptive learning rates reduce overfitting or overshooting as the model converges. Common methods include:
Reduce learning rate by a factor when validation loss plateaus.
Example: Use a scheduler in PyTorch or TensorFlow that reduces the learning rate by half after 3 epochs of no improvement in validation loss.

73. For distributed training with KKK machines/cores, should we use a higher or lower learning rate? Why?
Use a higher learning rate because the gradient updates from KKK machines are averaged, effectively scaling down the step size.
Example: When training ResNet on 8 GPUs, start with a learning rate of 0.08 instead of 0.01 (single GPU default).

74. How does batch size affect training of neural networks? What if we choose a batch size of 1?
Small batch sizes (e.g., 16):
Introduce noise in gradient updates, which can help avoid local minima but may slow down training.
Large batch sizes (e.g., 512):
More stable gradients but may lead to overfitting.
Batch size of 1: Leads to noisy updates and inefficient hardware usage.
Example: For image classification, start with 64 or 128. Using 1 would be inefficient unless processing very large images (e.g., medical imaging).

75. How is Word2Vec different from GloVe?
Word2Vec:
Learns embeddings by predicting context words (Skip-Gram) or target words (CBOW).
GloVe:
Learns embeddings from a co-occurrence matrix.
Example:
In Word2Vec: "king - man + woman = queen" because embeddings encode semantic relationships.
GloVe uses global co-occurrence, capturing broader contextual relationships.

76. For rare words, which should be used for Word2Vec training: CBOW or Skip-Gram?
Use Skip-Gram: It predicts context for each word, making it better for infrequent terms.
Example: Words like "epitome" or "taciturn" (rare) are better learned via Skip-Gram as CBOW averages the context, which may dilute rare-word meaning.

77. Is it possible for both validation loss and validation accuracy to increase?
Yes, if the model becomes overconfident, increasing certainty on correct predictions (accuracy) while also making larger errors on wrong predictions (higher loss).
Example: In image classification, the model misclassifies a "cat" as a "dog" with 95% confidence, increasing loss even if accuracy improves overall.

78. What can go wrong if we use a linear activation instead of ReLU?
Linear activations limit the network to simple linear relationships.
Example: Predicting housing prices with features like location, size, and amenities would fail to capture complex non-linear dependencies if only linear activations are used.

79. How does Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (CF) work in recommendations? What if the number of items is in billions?
Finds similar items based on user interactions and recommends them.
Example: On Amazon, if you bought a "smartphone," CF might suggest screen protectors and cases bought by others who purchased the same phone.
For billions of items, use approximate nearest neighbor techniques like Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to speed up similarity searches.

80. When would you choose Item-Based CF over User-Based CF?
Use Item-Based CF when:
Users are transient (e.g., anonymous visitors on e-commerce sites).
Items have fewer changes compared to users.
Example: In a bookstore, comparing books is easier because the catalog changes slowly, while user preferences can vary greatly.

81. How is matrix factorization useful in recommendation systems?
Decomposes user-item interactions into latent features representing user preferences and item properties.
Example: In Netflix, matrix factorization might reveal that a user who likes "action" movies will also like a new "superhero" movie, even without direct ratings.

82. What are the advantages and disadvantages of SGD over ALS in matrix factorization?
SGD:
Advantage: Can handle large, sparse data incrementally.
Disadvantage: Requires tuning the learning rate.
ALS:
Advantage: Faster for batch processing.
Disadvantage: Computationally expensive for dynamic or very sparse data.
Example: Use SGD for real-time updates in a news recommendation system.

83. How would you find KKK nearest neighbors efficiently with billions of data?
Use approximate methods like LSH or KD-Trees to reduce search complexity.
Example: Finding similar users for recommendations on Spotify with billions of tracks and users requires hashing-based approximations.

84. How does Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) work for finding nearest neighbors? What hash function is used?
How it works: Maps similar points into the same hash bucket using hash functions sensitive to proximity.
Example: For cosine similarity, use random projection hash functions to cluster text documents or user preferences.

85. Why is the choice of activation function important in neural networks?
Activation functions enable the model to capture non-linear patterns.
Example: Using ReLU in image classification ensures the network captures complex features like edges, textures, and patterns beyond linear relationships.

86. Why does overfitting occur in neural networks, and how can it be prevented?
Why: The model memorizes training data, including noise, instead of learning generalizable patterns.
Prevention:
Regularization (L1/L2 or Dropout).
Data augmentation to increase training diversity.
Example: In training a model on cat images, flipping and rotating images during augmentation can prevent overfitting.

87. How do Autoencoders differ from PCA for dimensionality reduction?
Autoencoders: Non-linear, learn complex relationships through a neural network.
PCA: Linear, identifies orthogonal directions of maximum variance.
Example: Autoencoders are better for reducing dimensionality in high-resolution image datasets with non-linear patterns.

88. What is the main goal of using Attention Mechanisms in NLP?
Attention mechanisms focus on important parts of the input while generating output.
Example: In translation, attention ensures the model emphasizes words like "gato" (cat) in Spanish when generating "cat" in English.

89. How do Transformers improve upon RNNs for sequence tasks?
Advantages:
Parallel processing through self-attention.
Better handling of long-range dependencies.
Example: In sentiment analysis, Transformers handle long reviews more effectively than RNNs, which struggle with long dependencies.

90. Why are pre-trained models like BERT or GPT important?
They provide general language understanding that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
Example: Fine-tune BERT for sentiment analysis to classify tweets as positive or negative.

1. What is overfitting, and how do you prevent it?
Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the noise and details of the training data to the extent that it performs poorly on unseen data.
Ways to prevent overfitting:
Regularization: Adds a penalty to large model weights (L1 or L2 regularization).
Cross-Validation: Splits the data into training and validation sets to monitor performance.
Pruning: Reduces the size of a decision tree by removing less significant branches.
Dropout (in neural networks): Randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during training.

2. What is regularization in machine learning?
Regularization is a technique used to reduce overfitting by discouraging overly complex models. It adds a penalty to the cost function for large weights.
Two common types:
L1 Regularization (Lasso): Encourages sparsity by reducing some feature weights to zero.
L2 Regularization (Ridge): Penalizes large weights to keep them small.

3. What is gradient descent, and how does it optimize machine learning models?
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost function by iteratively updating model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.
Types:
Batch Gradient Descent: Computes gradients over the entire dataset.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Updates parameters for each sample.
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: Uses small batches of data for updates.

4. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data to predict an output. Examples: Classification (spam detection) and regression (predicting prices).
Unsupervised Learning: The model finds patterns in unlabeled data. Examples: Clustering (customer segmentation) and dimensionality reduction (PCA).

5. What is a confusion matrix?
A confusion matrix is a table that describes the performance of a classification model by comparing true values with predicted values. Metrics derived from it include:
Accuracy: Correct predictions/Total predictions.
Precision: True PositivesTrue Positives + False Positives\frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Positives}}True Positives + False PositivesTrue Positives​.
Recall: True PositivesTrue Positives + False Negatives\frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Negatives}}True Positives + False NegativesTrue Positives​.

6. What are decision trees, and how do they work?

Key concepts:
Gini Impurity: Measures the likelihood of incorrect classification.
Information Gain: Reduces uncertainty in data after a split.
Splitting Criteria: Determines where to split data (e.g., Gini, entropy).

7. What is k-means clustering?

To determine kkk, use:
Elbow Method: Plots WCSS for various kkk values to find the "elbow."
Silhouette Score: Measures clustering quality.

8. What is the curse of dimensionality?
The curse of dimensionality refers to difficulties that arise as the number of features increases:
Increased computation.
Data sparsity, reducing meaningful patterns.
Solutions include dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) and feature selection.

9. What are ensemble models in machine learning?
Ensemble models combine predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy and generalization.
Types:

Boosting: Combines weak learners sequentially (e.g., XGBoost).
Stacking: Combines predictions using a meta-model.

10. What is transfer learning?
Transfer learning uses a pre-trained model on a related task and fine-tunes it for a new task. It reduces training time and data requirements. For example, using ImageNet models for medical image classification.
1. Linear Regression
Overview: Predicts a continuous outcome based on independent variables by establishing a linear relationship.

Interview Task: Derive the gradient descent formula for the logistic loss function.

5. ROC Curve
Overview: Visual representation of a classifier’s performance.
Example: Evaluating a fraud detection model.
Dataset: Transactions labeled as "fraud" or "not fraud."
ROC Curve:
Plot True Positive Rate (TPR) vs. False Positive Rate (FPR).
The closer the curve is to the top-left corner, the better.
Task: Compute the AUC score and interpret it.
Interview Scenario: Compare two models with different AUC scores and justify which is better.

6. Regularization Techniques
Overview: Prevents overfitting by adding a penalty to large coefficients.

Sample Questions and Answers
What are the different types of machine learning?
Supervised (uses labeled data), Unsupervised (uses unlabeled data), and Reinforcement Learning (goal-driven approach with rewards/punishments).
Explain overfitting and how to avoid it.
Overfitting is when a model memorizes training data, leading to poor generalization. Avoid using Regularization, Cross-Validation, and simpler models.

Key ML Tips
Random Forest vs. Decision Tree:
Use Decision Trees when explainability is critical, such as in scenarios where stakeholders need a clear justification for model decisions (e.g., banning a user on a platform).
Random Forests generally outperform Decision Trees in terms of accuracy but lack the clear, step-by-step decision-making visualization provided by Decision Trees.
When computational power is limited or for smaller datasets, Decision Trees are faster to train compared to Random Forests.
Q: Why might you choose Decision Trees over Random Forests? A: Decision Trees are preferable when explainability is critical, computational resources are limited, or the dataset is small.
Logistic Regression:
Despite being a classification algorithm, it is called "regression" because it calculates probabilities and uses a threshold to make binary classifications. It is based on linear regression but uses a logistic function to model probabilities.
Q: Why is Logistic Regression called regression despite being a classification algorithm? A: It predicts probabilities using a logistic function and thresholds, making it conceptually rooted in regression techniques.
Out-of-Bag Evaluation:
In Random Forests, certain data samples are not used during the training phase and are called "out-of-bag" samples. These samples are used for model validation to estimate performance without requiring a separate validation set.
Q: What are out-of-bag samples in Random Forests used for? A: They are used for validation to estimate model performance without needing a separate validation set.
Naïve Bayes:
The algorithm assumes independence between features, which simplifies calculations but may not hold true for all real-world datasets. Despite this limitation, it is effective for text classification and similar applications.
Q: What is a key assumption in Naïve Bayes, and when does it work well? A: It assumes feature independence and works well in tasks like text classification where this assumption approximately holds.
No Free Lunch Theorem:
There is no universally best ML model. The effectiveness of an algorithm depends on the specific problem and dataset. Testing and evaluating multiple models is necessary to find the best fit for a given task.
Q: What does the No Free Lunch Theorem imply for ML practitioners? A: It implies that no single model works best for all problems, so multiple models should be tested and evaluated.
Semi-Supervised Learning:
Combines labeled and unlabeled data to reduce labeling costs. For example, Google Photos uses semi-supervised learning to cluster similar faces and requests the user to label only one instance, after which the system labels the rest automatically.
Q: How does semi-supervised learning reduce labeling costs? A: It uses a few labeled data points to infer labels for the remaining data, minimizing manual labeling efforts.
Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data:
With increasing data, simpler algorithms can achieve performance levels comparable to complex algorithms. However, access to large datasets isn’t always feasible, making algorithm optimization equally important.
Q: What is the "unreasonable effectiveness of data" in ML? A: It refers to how increasing data quantity can make simpler algorithms perform comparably to complex ones.

2. Examples of Replies for Common ML Topics
Question: What is Overfitting, and how can you avoid it?
Reply:
Definition: Overfitting occurs when a model performs exceptionally well on training data but fails to generalize to unseen data. This happens because the model learns both the patterns and the noise in the training data.
How It Works: A model overfits when it becomes too complex (e.g., too many parameters) and starts memorizing the training data instead of learning the underlying trends.
Example: Imagine training a child to recognize fruits. If the child memorizes specific fruits in a basket but fails to identify new fruits, they’ve "overfitted."
Avoidance Techniques:
Use Regularization: Add penalties to the loss function (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization).
Cross-validation: Split the data into training and validation sets to monitor generalization.
Simplify the Model: Use fewer parameters or reduce the model’s complexity.
Dropout: For neural networks, randomly deactivate nodes during training.
Conclusion: Overfitting is detrimental as it reduces the model’s real-world applicability. By employing these techniques, you ensure the model generalizes better.

Question: What is a Confusion Matrix?
Reply:
Definition: A confusion matrix is a performance measurement tool for classification problems. It compares actual labels with predicted labels to evaluate the model.
Structure:
Rows: Represent actual classes.
Columns: Represent predicted classes.
Key Terms:
True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted positive cases.
True Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted negative cases.
False Positives (FP): Incorrectly predicted positive cases.
False Negatives (FN): Incorrectly predicted negative cases.
Example:
For a binary classification model predicting spam emails:
TP: Emails correctly classified as spam.
FN: Spam emails classified as non-spam.
Use Cases:
Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are derived from the confusion matrix.
Conclusion: A confusion matrix offers a detailed performance evaluation and helps identify whether a model is biased towards certain classes.

Question: What is the difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning?
Reply:
Definition:
Supervised Learning: Models are trained on labeled data.
Unsupervised Learning: Models are trained on unlabeled data to identify patterns.
Mechanics:
Supervised: Uses features (X) and targets (Y).
Unsupervised: Learns only from input features (X).
Examples:
Supervised: Predicting house prices based on size, location, etc.
Unsupervised: Grouping customers into segments based on purchasing behavior.
Use Cases:
Supervised: Fraud detection, sentiment analysis.
Unsupervised: Market segmentation, anomaly detection.
Conclusion: The choice between the two depends on data availability and the problem’s nature.

Question: Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.
Reply:
Definition: The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the balance between two sources of error:
Bias: Error due to oversimplified assumptions.
Variance: Error due to model sensitivity to data variations.
Tradeoff:
A high-bias model (underfitting) doesn’t capture enough detail.
A high-variance model (overfitting) is overly complex and sensitive.
Example:
A linear regression on a non-linear dataset (high bias).
A high-degree polynomial model that fits every data point (high variance).
Solution:
Use cross-validation to tune model complexity.
Regularization techniques like Ridge or Lasso Regression.
Conclusion: Balancing bias and variance ensures better generalization and minimizes total error.

Question: What is Feature Engineering?
Reply:
Definition: Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, or creating features to improve model performance.
Steps:
Feature selection: Identify relevant variables.
Feature creation: Generate new features (e.g., interaction terms).
Feature transformation: Scale, encode, or bin features.
Example: For a loan prediction model:
Feature Selection: Use income and credit score.
Transformation: Normalize income.
Creation: Combine income and credit score into a "credit-worthiness" score.
Tools:
Scikit-learn: StandardScaler, PCA.
Pandas: Feature creation via transformations.
Conclusion: Effective feature engineering is critical for reducing noise and improving model accuracy.

Question: What is Cross-Validation, and why is it important?
Reply:
Definition: Cross-validation splits the data into multiple subsets to train and validate a model iteratively, ensuring robust performance evaluation.
Types:
K-Fold Cross-Validation: Divides data into K folds, using one for validation and the rest for training.
Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV): Uses all data points except one for training.
